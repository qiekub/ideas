thursday septemb __ ____ the distribut of nutrient carrier within a cell overlaid on a diagram of the starburstshap microtubul that act as the cell highway
in a new studi that may have import applic in research from the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY california/ENTITY santa/ENTITY barbara/ENTITY found that cell have evolv a surpris but effici way to regul the transport of good to the and surround and signal outsid of a cell get to the cell nucleus by way of carrier call endosom travel through a cell on a highway of structur support call research studi the motion of endosom by put tag which glow under certain type of light on individu endosom and record their motion through a they found that endosom do not travel straight to the nucleus instead they random travel toward and away from the nucleus with no prefer direct
this is a littl like get in the car to drive to work but instead of be caught in heavi traffic along the main road random choos a back road to follow if you end up be caught in traffic go that way you can also turn around and travel in the opposit direct for a while it would make get to work a littl slow but it lead to an even distribut of endosom all along the microtubul
this find surpris the santa barbara group endosom are most concentr around the nucleus of a cell so research expect that the endosom would usual travel toward the nucleus
comput simul show that the layout of the microtubul system is respons for the high concentr of endosom at the nucleus it all in the of the cell said samir/ENTITY mitragotri/ENTITY a research on the project
endosom random travel toward or away from the nucleus and can chang direct but as in where all road lead to the endosom get to their destin becaus all road eventu pass the nucleus this system doe not get a particular endosom to it target as quick as possibl but ensur that nutrient transport is not disrupt if the cell move or there is increas traffic
some heart diseas are caus by the break down of that regul endosom movement scientist are not sure what this doe to the cell said samir mitragotri a coauthor of the studi but research like this could help them discov the miss link between diseas and transport properti
