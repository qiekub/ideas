zork hun is run for the libertarian parti in the ontario provinci elect in the parkdalehigh park ride wikinew nick moreau interview him regard his valu his experi and his campaign
stay tune for further interview everi candid from everi parti is elig and will be contact expect interview from liber progress conserv new democrat parti member ontario green as well as member from the famili coalit freedom communist libertarian and confeder of region parti as well as independ
whi have you chosen to involv yourself in the polit process
at a recent feder elect i was so appal by the avail choic that i couldnt make ani
sinc i take my civic respons serious i decid to get involv
when i came to canada i was simpli an anticommunist but as i explor the issu i am interest in i slowli drift toward libertarian i resist the label for a long time but part of my decis to get involv was to embrac it i consid myself to be a social libertarian akin to charl murray what this mean is that my main concern is the damag that the state can caus to societi
i am alarm by our slow drift toward social and i think i must speak up to warn those who have no idea what at the end of the road
whi did you choos to run in this constitu
becaus i live in it it is among the most hostil ride to our idea but i am not in this race to win i am in it to repres an altern i am uncompromis in my idea i couldnt possibl compromis on tactic by choos a ride where i could have hope for a few more vote
my ride has a few veri distinct neighbourhood the one i live in roncesvall villag is in the process of chang from ethnicpolish to yuppiealtern peopl full of misguid middl class guilt and an ear for the siren song of the ndp parkdal repres anoth solid ndp territori
high park and swansea are a littl more to the right but still on the left side of middl
when you see a middl age wasp man with rastafarian hairdo and a bush is the real terrorist tshirt at an all candid meet you know that you are not in libertarian territori
but as i said i am here to stand up not to win
what prior polit experi do you have
none in my school year i was part of the communist youth organ leadership on both school i attend but i realli hope that nobodi will hold this against me i hope to have redeem myself with the _ month i spent in a communist jail as a polit prison
what skill and insight can you bring to offic from other nonpolit posit you may have held
the most import of my experi is the close observ of the work of a communist countri i was work as a sociolog research organ work on sever project show us how the benevol condescens of the state can kill the spirit of civil societi
which of your competitor do you expect to pose the biggest challeng to your candidaci whi
the libertarian parti advoc a minim state for sever reason we believ that a larg state apparatus and ambiti govern program are bad for the economi bad for civil societi bad for individu liberti the most clear statist parti in ontario is the ndp promis anyth without ani consider to cost feasibl or to the potenti damag the promis polici can caus they are by far the most power hungri and the most aggress in their pursuit of power
cheri dinovo attitud exemplifi perfect both the aggress and the irrespons but it seem to work for her amaz well
what make you the most desir of all candid run in the ride
i repres the onli parti with a coher polit philosophi the onli one that deriv his polici consist from moral axiom and well proven econom principl
we have simpl straightforward answer to everi issu rais in this elect we base everi one of our polici on
faith in and respect for peopl
trust in the power of the free market
our commit to noncoerc measur
we repres a moral and practic altern oppos to the polici to all three statist parti
what do you feel are the three most import issu to voter in your ride are these the same top three issu that are most import to you what would you do to address these issu
my impress from particip in all candid meet is that the most import issu is incom redistribut everybodi want somebodi els to pay for what they want and the ndp is more than will to promis anyth to them
the second issu is educ peopl seem to have a problem with the notion of religi educ
the third issu is trust my impress is that peopl do not know who to trust and are tri to figur out which of the candid could be the most trustworthi manag i dont think peopl are look for sweep new program they just want compet manag
my top three issu are incom transfer govern monopoli especi in educ and account
the ongo polit of govern take money away from success busi and hardwork individu just to hand it to bad manag busi and special interest group are caus untold amount of harm to the economi also see my answer below on job creation these direct money transfer should stop
the taglin of our parti say that we are the parti of choic to us this doe not mean that we want to chang let say educ or health care we just want to open the door to chang allow peopl to make choic for themselv as individu this would includ allow privat health care and insur offer and an uncondit educ voucher system allow the market in is the onli thing that can repair the problem of our health care and educ system
account for me mean a lot more than hold politician and govern bureaucrat respons for their action it mean to account for and justifi the spend of everi dollar they handl polit parti can get away with wast becaus peopl do not know what the money is spent on
what should be the first order of busi in the __th legisl assembl
introduc a bill requir strict fiscal respons from all futur govern set veri high requir ____ of all mpps for the approv of ani deficit spend
are the properti tax in your ride at a fair level for the amount of servic receiv in the municip
absolut not market valu base assess is fundament unfair sinc the veri essenc of the idea is unfair how could we possibl talk about a fair level the onli fair tax is one that is base on servic or resourc use a combin of lot size floor space and of inhabit
if i reformul your question to say are the tax you pay commensur with the servic you receiv the answer would be no we are not get ____ worth of servic from the citi
how can the provinc lead the way in stimul job creation
by stop the redistribut of incom between busi
a pictur a few year ago on my tax return provid a tell exampl on two pie chart we saw incom and expens what was strike in the chart was the similar in size of two item the incom from corpor tax and the expens that is paid out as corpor subsidi the incom was __ higher but the similar was still strike what this mean is that the govern is take away money from success busi and give it to polit favour one
my answer would be the elimin of both corpor incom tax and corpor welfar the onli function of the corpor incom tax is to give more power to politician individu taxpay wouldnt even notic the differ and a corporatetax friend environ would give a tremend boost to the economi
what are your view on the mix member proport represent mmp referendum
my parti is divid on the subject and i am person right in the middl
i follow close the work of the citizen assembl i even made a present my present address the question of legitimaci not the issu that is the question of the referendum
to the referendum question my posit is a reluct yes
the pros for the chang are as follow
the new system reflect better the distribut of vote and therefor the will of the peopl
it will give a chanc to smaller parti
it will creat a more cooper legisl environ by make it more difficult to have major govern
the con are the follow
we will have more politician with more caus to champion more polit support wait for a payback for that support
we will have more deal make to make coalit work result in more program more spend higher tax less freedom
in the end we will have more polit and less freedom which is what we stand against yet for me the first argument for the one say that it repres the will of the voter better tilt the scale toward the yes vote
what role if ani doe new media play in your campaign and the campaign of your parti websit blog facebook youtub video etc do you view it as benefici or a challeng
not enough ask me again at the next elect
of the decis made by ontario __th legisl assembl which was the most benefici to your this elector district to the provinc as a whole which was least benefici or even harm to your this ride to the provinc as a whole
i pass on this one i would have to studi it more
