saturday septemb __ ____
a stori about a man carri over _____ sometim report as _____ static/ENTITY electr/ENTITY in his bodi alleg generat by a wool sweater and nylon jacket combin is circul through major news outlet the stori carri first by the standard say that the man frank clewer a __year old cleaner from involuntarili creat a scene by caus fire depart to evacu three build where he had left his mark befor he realiz he was caus the burn mark on carpet and allow the fire depart to help him
the stori has been pick up by the/ENTITY regist/ENTITY usa/ENTITY today/ENTITY local agenc of san/ENTITY francisco/ENTITY chronicl/ENTITY and other news outlet
sever unansw object mark the stori as a possibl hoax
clewer enter and exit his car sever time in the stori if he open the car by touch it presum metal lock he would sure releas some electr into the car through his hand everyon has at some point experienc the pain shock of touch a door handl or car key to a lock though the car might not be it would still be at a lower potenti and thus energi would be transfer this would be notic the stori doe not comment that clewer understood what was happen to him
firefight suppos use a devic to check static electr on him and his belong while firefight would be like to carri a highvoltag around to measur the rate of down power line it is unlik that the same devic could measur such a larg voltag result from a veri small amount of static energi without deelectrifi it
for such a larg voltag to be store humid would have to have been extrem low on that day for the air around him not to ioniz and sourc current remov the static energi
if he was carri such a larg voltag his hair would probabl have stood on end as this is a notabl effect when one touch a van/ENTITY de/ENTITY graaf/ENTITY generat/ENTITY note it is uncertain at what voltag this effect begin and sinc van de graaf machin routin exceed megavolt of electr potenti this may not be a verifi object
this statement firefight took possess of clewer jacket and store it in the courtyard of the fire station where it continu to give off a strong electr reuter uk first there is no reason they would need to take possess of the jacket the static electr could be dealt with by simpli dump water on it second the jacket could not give off an electr current without some continu sourc of energi which in storag is imposs it is possibl that the jacket could hold a voltag but the effect of this would not be visibl if they were they would be shortliv as the jacket would lose it static energi in ani event the current would be miniscul
the amount of energi store on clewer person and possess could not have been more than a few joul this is unlik to have burn carpet
the equat for store energi in where u energi c and v a human bodi by itself typic has a capacit of around ___ which would mean a voltag of _____ v would produc energi of ___ even if clewer possess result in a parallel capacit of _ this would still onli result in an energi storag of ___ j this amount of energi would be insuffici to burn carpet or char plastic although a spark could ignit flammabl vapor or gas
