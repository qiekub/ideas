in find publish on wednesday in scienc/ENTITY advanc/ENTITY research from the georgia/ENTITY institut/ENTITY of/ENTITY technolog/ENTITY gt and univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY south/ENTITY carolina/ENTITY beaufort/ENTITY both in the unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY warm/ENTITY sea/ENTITY appear to decreas the efficaci of the chemic compound that s releas into the water to defend themselv from bacteria and encroach seawe but these loss may be mitig if there are larg number of hungri fish around a millepora show greater resist to bleach in reef with more fish
the research was led by mark/ENTITY hay/ENTITY a marin ecologist and regent/ENTITY professor/ENTITY at gt who said there is a lot of argument now about whether local manag can help in the face of global stress whether what a villag doe matter when peopl in los/ENTITY angel/ENTITY burn fossil fuel to drive to work hay ad our work indic that local manag provid a degre of insur against global stress but there are like higher temperatur that render the insur ineffect
the research examin three type of coral in reef off the coast of fiji acropora/ENTITY millepora/ENTITY porit/ENTITY cylindrica/ENTITY pocillopora/ENTITY damicorni/ENTITY some of these reef were in area where fish was prohibit and some were not the research found when fish were plenti they would eat alga and seawe off the coral which appear to leav them more resist to the bacterium vibrio/ENTITY coralliilyticus/ENTITY a bacterium associ with bleach
the research suggest the alga like warm temperatur might render the coral chemic defens less effect and the fish were protect the coral by remov the alga they report macroalga are suggest to disrupt coral microbiom via transfer of allelochem or microb or releas of dissolv organ carbon that affect microbi growth
p cyclindrica and p damicorni are known to be function under condit that damag other coral and a millepora is not
each reefbuild coral unit is a collect of polyp live in symbiot/ENTITY partnership/ENTITY alga the polyp a as are jellyfish provid sting protect and secret a calcium shell and the alga perform photosynthesi produc oxygen and give the coral it color chang ocean environ have led to a phenomenon call coral/ENTITY bleach/ENTITY when warmer water caus the cnidarian to expel the alga from it bodi which turn the coral reef white this doe not kill the cnidarian partner but doe leav it bad weaken and vulner to diseas
