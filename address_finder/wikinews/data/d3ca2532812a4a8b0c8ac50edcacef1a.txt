as you campaign around your ride it like that some issu are mention more often by voter than other issu what would you say are the three hottest topic this elect in your ride what would you and your parti do to address these issu
the three topic that peopl are rais with me are
afford the rise cost of live hous energi univers tuition etc coupl with littl or no increas in real wage is make it hard for the typic constitu to make end meet
healthcar particular around the cost of prescript care of the elder increas privat etc
childcar educ environ transit okay that make more than three issu in total but these are all critic and interrel if we want to give peopl the option of not drive their car for work and shop we must provid an afford and usabl transit system and of cours there is no point in address ani of these issu if we have alreadi destroy our environ
i would be a strong voic in ottawa for all of these concern use the solid ndp platform as the base from which to amplifi the voic of the constitu of vancouv kingsway
the ndp would revers some of the __ billion in corpor tax cut brought in under the conserv govern jack layton plan to move canada forward start with protect good job and foster new one in a new energi economi this is a plan for chang that tackl the grow gap between the rich and the rest with polici thatll help famili like our make end meet
the ndp has alreadi launch a plan to phase in univers prescript drug coverag to protect today famili from soar cost includ measur to reduc drug cost at sourc the ndp have expos and challeng harper failur to stop usstyl privat call for reliabl feder fund link to provinci commit not to subsid the expans of forprofit care jack layton has consist advoc more longterm care space and expand home care coverag to offer senior digniti in their later year and take pressur off scarc hospit bed
the ndp would invest ___ billion in a nation childcar network from coast to coast jack layton note that everi day famili across our countri struggl to find good qualiti child care they can afford you shouldnt have to worri about whether your child is go to be safe and get good care the ndp would offer provinc and territori a bind commit to stabl longterm fund for postsecondari educ through a dedic transfer in return for an equal bind commit to better access and lower tuition fee
the ndp would creat a cap and trade system to help combat global warm which would ensur that big pollut pay their fair share and it make it possibl for more peopl to afford green solut explain jack layton
the ndp plan to dedic one cent a litr of the feder gas tax to transit would mean ___ million for vancouv transit over four year and vancouv share of the transit revenu from our capandtrad plan would mean an addit ___ million over four year
are there ani misconcept about you your leader or your parti and platform
the singl most persist misconcept about our parti is that it is fiscal irrespons howev a ____ feder govern report show that ndp govern have the best fiscal trackrecord among all parti balanc the book more than twice as often than liber govern manitoba ndp govern has pose surplus everi year it has been in offic and saskatchewan ndp govern post __ consecut balanc budget after end a decad of conserv mismanag and corrupt
there a more way than ever to get your messag out from the tradit campaign flier and lawn sign to new media like websit facebook and youtub the triedandtru rout get the messag out to the mass much easier but digit altern are much more measur in how mani are see or interact with your campaign what seem to be the most effect from your experi
both the tradit and the new media approach are essenti in ani modern campaign
leaflet and lawn sign are effect at get out your messag while phone and knock on door is essenti if you want to identifi your support howev these approach are cost andor time consum relat to the new media
a websit is absolut essenti to allow peopl to check out on their own initi your background your stand on the issu and how to contact you it also allow for peopl easili to ask question donat or get involv in the campaign
other tool such as youtub facebook twitter etc have also enter the mainstream they provid a relat inexpens method of reach the digerati and onlin support and often provid an opportun for feedback
the new media may let you measur how mani peopl are receiv your messag but they do not yet track what impact that actual has on their opinion and vote decis web __ perhap elect canada vancouv kingsway extern link offici campaign site
