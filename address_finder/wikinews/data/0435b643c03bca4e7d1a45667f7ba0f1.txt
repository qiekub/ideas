a close encount with the supermass black/ENTITY hole/ENTITY at the center of the milki/ENTITY way/ENTITY has set a star on a one way trip into intergalact space the star detect at the observatori in is zip outward at a speed of __ million mile per hour rocket along at twice the galact escap veloc the milki/ENTITY way/ENTITY gravit attract doesnt have the hold power to keep the star from disappear into the empti between galaxi
we have never befor seen a star move fast enough to complet escap the confin of our galaxi warren brown of the harvardsmithsonian/ENTITY center/ENTITY for/ENTITY astrophys/ENTITY cfa said were tempt to call it the outcast star becaus it was forc toss from it home onli the power graviti of a veri massiv black hole could propel a star with enough forc to exit our galaxi
use measur of the star lineofsight veloc the scientist have conclud the star catalog as sdss j____________ is move almost direct away from galact center composit and age of the star also provid evid of the star origin and ultim fate becaus this is a metalrich star we believ that it recent came from a starform region like that in the galact center said brown less than __ million year were need for the star to reach it current locat which is consist with it estim age
margaret j geller michael j kurtz and scott j kenyon along with brown will publish their find in an upcom issu of the astrophys journal
the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophys is base in cambridg massachusett where scientist studi the origin evolut and ultim fate of the univers
