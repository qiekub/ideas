sunday may __ ____ stardust is a space capsul that collect sampl from comet also known as wild _ in deep space and land back on earth on januari __ ____ it was decid that a collabor onlin review process would be use to discov the microscop small sampl the capsul collect the project is call distribut/ENTITY comput/ENTITY project like url reli entir on human intellig
andrew westphal is the director of url wikinew interview him for may interview of the month iotm on may __ ____ as alway the interview was conduct on with multipl peopl ask question
some may not know exact what stardust or url is can you explain more about it for us artist render of spacecraft stardust
stardust is a nasa discoveri mission that was launch in ____ it is realli two mission in one the primari scienc goal of the mission was to collect a sampl from a known primit solarsystem bodi a comet call wild _ pronounc vilttwo the discover was german i believ this is the first sampl return mission sinc and the first ever from beyond the moon this give a littl context by sampl return of cours i mean a mission that bring back extraterrestri materi i should have said abov that this is the first solid sampl return mission genesi brought back a sampl from the sun almost two year ago but stardust is also bring back the first solid sampl from the local interstellar medium basic this is a sampl of the galaxi this is absolut unpreced and were obvious incred excit i should mention parenthet that there is a fantast launch video taken from the pov of the rocket on the jpl stardust websit high recommend best ive ever seen all the way from the launch pad too basic interplanetari trajectori absolut great
is the video avail to the public
yes see ok i digress the first challeng that we have befor can do ani kind of analysi of these interstellar dust particl is simpli to find them this is a big challeng becaus they are veri small order of micron in size and are somewher we dont know where on a huge collector at least on the scale of the particl size about a tenth of a squar meter so
were right now use an autom microscop that we develop sever year ago for nuclear astrophys work to scan the collector in the cosmic dust lab in build __ at johnson space center this is the are group that handl return sampl moon rock genesi chip meteorit and interplanetari dust particl collect by u_ in the stratospher the microscop collect stack of digit imag of the aerogel collector in the array these imag are sent to us we compress them and convert them into a format appropri for url
url is a high distribut project use a virtual microscop that is written in html and javascript and run on most browser no download are requir use the virtual microscop volunt can search over the collector for the track of the interstellar dust particl aerogel slice remov with an ultrason blade show particl track
how mani sampl do you anticip be found dure the cours of the project
great question the short answer is that we dont know the long answer is a bit more complic here what we know the galileo and ulyss spacecraft carri dust detector onboard that eberhard gruen and his colleagu use to first detect and them measur the flux of interstellar dust particl stream into the solar system this is a kind of wind of interstellar dust caus by the fact that our solar system is move with respect to the local interstellar medium markus landgraf has estim the number of interstellar dust particl that should have been captur by stardust dure two period of the cruis phase of the interplanetari orbit in which the spacecraft was move with this wind he estim that there should be around __ particl but this number is veri uncertain i wouldnt be surpris if it is quit differ from that that was the long answer one thing that i should sayi that like all research the outcom of what we are do is high uncertain there is a wonder quot attribut to einstein if we knew what we were do it wouldnt be call research would it
how big would the sampl be
we expect that the particl will be of order a micron in size a millionth of a meter when peopl are search use the virtual microscop they will be look not for the particl but for the track that the particl make which are much larger sever micron in diamet just yesterday we switch over to a new site which has a demo of the vm virtual microscop i invit you to check it out the track in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particl that were shot into aerogel use a particl acceler modifi to acceler dust particl to veri high speed to simul the interstellar dust impact that were look for
and that on the main url websit see how long will the project take to complet
part the answer depend on what you mean by the project the search will take sever month the bottleneck we expect but dont realli know yet is in the scan we can onli scan about one tile per day and there are ___ tile in the collector these particl will be quit divers so were hope that well continu to have lot of volunt collabor with us on this after the initi discoveri it may be that the __th particl that we find will be the real rosetta stone that turn out to be critic to our understand of interstellar dust so we realli want to find them all enlarg the idea of the project a littl beyond the search though is to actual analyz these particl that the whole point obvious
and this is the huge advantag with this kind of a mission a sampl return mission
most mission rather do thing quit differ you have to build an instrument to make a measur and that instrument design get lock in sever year befor launch practic guarante that it will be obsolet by the time you launch here exact the opposit is true sever of the instrument that are now be use to analyz the cometari dust did not exist when the mission was launch further some instrument eg synchrotron are the size of shop mall you dont have a hope of fli these in space so we can and will studi these sampl for mani year and we have to preserv some of these dust particl for our grandchildren to analyz with their hyperquarkgluon plasma microscop or whatev
when do you anticip the project to start
were realli frustrat with the delay that weve been have some of it has to do with learn how to deal with the aerogel collector which are rougher and more fractur than we expect the good news is that they are pretti clean there is veri littl of the dust that you see on our train imag these were deliber left out in the lab to collect dust so that we could give peopl experi with the worst case we could think of in learn how to do the scan of the actual flight aerogel we uncov a coupl of bug in our scan softwar which forc us to go back and rescan part of the other reason for the delay was that we had to learn how to handl the collector it would cost ___m to replac it if someth happen to it so we had to develop procedur to deal with it and add sever new safeti featur to the cosmic dust lab this all took time final were distract becaus we also have mani respons for the cometari analysi which has a deadlin of august __ for finish analysi the is project has no such deadlin so at time we had to delay the is interstellar sorri in order to focus on the cometari work we are veri grate to everyon for their patienc on this i mean that veri sincer
and rest assur that were just as frustrat
i know there will be a test that particip will have to take befor they can examin the real thing what will that test consist of
the test will look veri similar to the train imag that you can look at now but there will of cours be no annot to tell you where the track are
whi did nasa decid to take the rout of distribut comput will they do this again
i wouldnt say that nasa decid to do this the idea for url origin here at u c berkeley part of the idea of cours came
if i understand correct it isnt distribut comput but distribut eyebal
from the url peopl who are just down the hall from us but as brian just point out this is not realli distribut comput like url the comput are just platform for the vm and it is human eye and brain who are do the real work which make it fun imho
that said there have been quit a few peopl who have express interest in develop autom algorithm for search just becaus we dont know how to write such an algorithm doesnt mean nobodi doe were delight at this and are happi to help make it happen
isnt there a catch __ that the data your go to collect would be a prerequisit to autom the process
that was the conclus that we came to earli on that we would need some sort of train set to be abl to train an algorithm of cours you have to train peopl too but were hope well see that peopl are more flexibl in recogn thing that theyv never seen befor and point them out our experi is that peopl who have never seen a track in aerogel can learn to recogn them veri quick even against a big background of crack dust and other sourc of confus come back to the origin question although nasa didnt origin the idea they are veri generous support this project it wouldnt have happen without nasa financi support and of cours access to the stardust collector did that answer the question
will a project like this be done again
i dont know there are onli a few project for which this approach make sens in fact i frank havent run across anoth at least in space scienc but i am total open to the idea of it i am not in favor of just do it as makework that is just artifici take this approach when anoth approach would make more sens
how did the idea come up to do this kind of project
realli desper when we first thought about this we assum that we would use some sort of autom imag recognit techniqu we ask some expert around here in cs and the conclus was that the problem was somewher between trivial and imposs and we wouldnt know until we had some real exampl to work with so we talk with dan wertheim and dave anderson liter down the hall from us about the idea of a distribut project and they were quit encourag dave propos the vm machineri and josh von korff a physic grad student implement it beauti i think i take no credit
i got to meet one of the stardust director in march dure the texa aerospac scholar program at jsc she talk about search for meteor in antarctica one that were unblemish by earth condit is that our best chanc of find new inform on comet and asteroid or will more stardust program be our best solut
that a realli good question much will depend on what we learn dure this offici preliminari examin period for the cometari analysi aerogel captur is pretti darn good but it not perfect and thing are alter dure captur in way that were still understand i think that much also depend on what question your ask for exampl some of the most import scienc is done by measur the relat abund of isotop in sampl and these are not affect at least not much by captur into aerogel
also she talk about how some of the agenc that they gave sampl to had lost or destroy __ sampl while tri to analyz them that one in fact had been static charg and stuck to the side of the microscop len and they spent over an hour look for it is that realli our biggest danger give out sampl as a show of good faith and not let nasa exampl all sampl collect
these will be the first measur probabl that well make on the interstellar dust there is alway a risk of loss fortun for the cometari sampl there is quit a lot there so it not a disast nasa has some analyt capabl particular at jsc but the vast major of the analyt capabl in the communiti is not at nasa but is at univers govern lab and other institut all over the world i should also point out that practic everi analyt techniqu is destruct at some level there are a few except but not mani the problem with meteorit is that except in a veri few case we dont know where they specif came from so have a sampl that we know for sure is from the comet is golden
i am current work on my bachelor in comput scienc with a minor in astronomi do you see success of program like stardust to open up more privat space explor posit for peopl such as myself even though im not in the typic space field of educ
can you elabor on your question a littl im not sure that i understand
well while at jsc i learn that they most want engin and a few scienc grad and i worri that my comput scienc degre with not be veri valuabl as the nasa rep told me onli _ of the applic for their work studi program are cs major im just curious as to your thought on if cs major will be more in demand now that project like stardust and the mar mission have been great success have you seen a trend toward more privat busi move in that direct especi with presid bush statement of man on the moon in ____
that a good question i am person not veri optimist about the direct that nasa is go despit recent success includ but not limit to stardust scienc at nasa is be decim
i made a joke with some peopl at the tas event that one day spaceshipon will be sent up to save strand iss astronaut it make me wonder what kind of privat redund the us govern is take for futur mission
i guess one thing to be a littl cautious about is that despit spaceshipon success we havent had an orbit project that has been success in that style of privat enterpris it would be nice to see that happen i know that there a lot of interest
now i know the answer to this question but a lot do not when sampl are found how will they be analyz who get the credit for find the sampl
the first person who identifi an interstellar dust particl will be acknowledg on the websit and probabl will be much in demand for interview from the media will have the privileg of name the particl and will be a coauthor on ani paper that we at ucb publish on the analysi of the particl also although we are preclud from pay for travel expens we will invit those who discov particl and the top perform to our lab for a handson tour
we have some fun thing includ micromachin
how mani peopleparticip do you expect to have
about ______ have preregist on our websit frank i dont have a clue how mani will actual volunt and do a substanti amount of search weve never done this befor after all
one last thing i want to say well two first we are go to special effort not to do ani search ourselv befor we go live it would not be fair to all the volunt for us to get a jumpstart on the search all we are do is look at a few random view to make sure that the focus and illumin are good and we havent seen anyth no surpris at all also the attitud for this should be have fun if your not have fun do it stop and do someth els a good maxim for life in general extern link launch video url websit
