q much of brampton exist council is season in the civic polit process what could you bring to the tabl as a rooki abov and beyond the current roster of councilor
a the present council seem to be away of the realiti in this fast grow citi they are veteran with all respect they are in urgent need of retir were grate of their effort and commit for all these year but we must now realiz that they are all run out of idea theyv been cut off guard by the popul growth and they seem to be trail behind look desper for way to catch up with a train speed away the best way to give a better futur to our citi is to give the chanc to rooki to come in with fresh mind and fresh idea that would help our citi to cope with this sudden growth we need to rejuven the council chamber and creat some sort of posit action that would consolid the path of brampton in this twenti first centuri we all appreci the hard work done by our predecessor but it is the time to look beyond their path of action and act accord to keep brampton into the right direct
brampton has now a divers cultur and ethnic that in realiti should be our strength the exist council despit their talk is not realli walk the talk there are no action to realli creat a sens of belong to these newcom in our citi without a doubt there is need of new energi a need of rejuven
there are obvious action that a council should tackl which havent been done proper certain theyv been there so long that they dont see ani pressur or oblig we must work to support our youth senior and peopl with special need we must improv on the present infrastructur and develop the public transit within brampton and beyond of cours the safeti measur are paramount and it is import to creat a great atmospher of respect and collabor between polic and the communiti we must not forget that the communiti is import in solv mani crime
in collabor with bramptonian we must ensur that the recreat aspect are well consid through park recreat center and cultur program
the citi must remain safe secur clean live and vibrant at all time
q the rose theatr recent launch what are your thought on this facil have you had a chanc to tour it yet
ath rose theatr is the sort of action that i would encourag as citi councilor of cours beyond this sort of infrastructur we must alway seek and keep in mind the wellb of our popul the cultur sens that the rose bring is certain part of the wellb of bramptonian howev we must ensur that each of us in the citi can realli have a stake of that wellb
i have tour the facil and enjoy with my daughter a kid show and was also in the crowd few day ago for a splendid comedi show rose theatr is definit the way to go but we must notic how long it took to the previous council chamber to offer to this citi what it realli deserv that must be said loud
we need to diversifi action that would ensur that each bramptonian actual have someth to cherish make him comfort to live and rais his children in brampton i do believ that the downtown core of brampton is miss mani other thing there is a clear urban develop miss as far as i am concern the rose theatr must be the begin of a long develop program of our downtown i would make sure as citi councilor that we continu in this path with more depth
q the provinc has strong encourag the develop of highdens resid near the downtown do these build fit in with your vision of the downtown how much say should other level of govern have in urban plan
a the good thing materi by the new rose theatr must not be the onli downtown develop action our downtown must be revit and the highdens resid and precis the high rise condominium build must be the next step downtown brampton must be the center of the citi and the biggest center of attract in mani way today we are realli million mile away of that vision
as citi councilor along with bramptonian and all level of govern i would deepli work to reviv our downtown core high rise and high densiti resid are definit part of my vision and brampton must be befor ____ well into it in order to fulli fit in this twenti first centuri
q how do you feel about brampton rate of expans council recent cap the annual amount of new develop do you agre complet with this decis would you have slow develop even further or not have impos a cap at all
a i strong believ that the brampton rate of expans is excess out of control and way beyond what is accept i have the feel that is essenti driven by financi gain and the wellb of the popul is not place at the center of this abus develop no doubt the present council has cap the annual amount of new develop although this restrict came a littl too late
look __ to __ year down the road the develop weve wit these last year would be a challeng if we do not anticip and proactiv prevent it negat effect
i am a strong advoc of a slow and control develop while ensur the popul safeti and wellb
the brutal develop of the last year is the main culprit of the traffic congest and the blatant need of the extens of ___ or even the construct of a new highway the cap set at the moment is welcom howev it is not the solut but part of the solut we must first and foremost control the develop slow it down if necessari or acceler it if the condit are ideal
q what are your opinion on brampton congest and the level of public transit fund
a i am shock and asham to see a new develop area deal with traffic congest it show that the present council has not done their homework proper and allow an excess develop without ensur that there was the proper infrastructur around who are now pay the price bramptonian theyv never been at the center of the preoccup of the council and financi interest took the power over the popul wellb this must be said and must be condemn
in the same token the public transit develop has not follow the popul growth and the new develop within the citi the present council has not push deep enough to secur and increas the necessari fund that would allow bramptonian to proper move within the citi or outsid the citi while avoid long wait hour if the bus actual show up
we must look for an immedi remedi of the issu and intens work to restor the confid of the popul in term of congest regular and avail of the public transit to do that we must increas the fund level and set it at the level which would provid to bramptonian what they actual need
q whi should busi be attract to locat in brampton
awe do have in brampton an increas high number of skill workforc readi to dynam commit to work ___ brampton is definit a parad for various busi and there is enough place and land to satisfi their need as for the urban develop of the citi the busi attract should be control and bramptonian interest must dictat this polici
q how could brampton further itself in attract corpor invest
a of cours if the council show an effect and effici municip manag it would be a strong showcas to attract corpor investor in brampton this attract is definit paramount to ensur the econom develop of the citi and also the wellb of bramptonian who will be provid their expertis to these busi
to ensur the effici of such attract we much encourag corpor invest by provid to these investor a window of tax break for a defin period of time establish competit municip tax rate which by itself would lure mani investor organ showcas session invit investor and public the million reason whi their invest are worth be done in brampton we must definit use the fast growth of the citi and the strong base of skill and profession worker present in brampton as a huge incent for invest
q whi have you chosen to involv yourself in the polit process
a i believ i have what it take to bring hope and energi in bramptonian life i do believ i have the vision that would help brampton to distinguish itself among other municip in this twenti first centuri i strong believ that i can turn our divers into a huge strength and forc that would propel brampton into a respect level i think brampton as a multiethn and multi cultur citi has what it take to be a canada model i do have what brampton need to achiev it
