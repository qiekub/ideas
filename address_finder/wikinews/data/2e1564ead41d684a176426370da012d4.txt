correct august __ ____
the sourc titl discoveri of ogl ____blg___lb the first cool rockyici exoplanet is indic below as publish by the institut dastrophysiqu de pari howev the publish is in fact the probe lens anomali network planet collabor the error is regret an intern group of __ scientist use _ project led by jeanphilipp beaulieu and martin dominik robonet led by michael
bode and keith horn led by andrzej udalski and led by phil yock from __ institut in __ countri have discov the smallest earthlik planet yet
the new planet is about _____ light year away and is close to the center of the milki/ENTITY way/ENTITY the discoveri was announc in the journal the journal also state the planet was found use a method call gravit/ENTITY microlens/ENTITY which detect small planet with a mass like that of gravit/ENTITY microlens/ENTITY is where a light from a distant star is bent and magnifi by the gravit field of a foreground star the presenc of a planet around the foreground star caus light from the distant star to becom momentarili brighter
howev scientist say that the cold temperatur on the planet make the chanc of find ani life on it unlik
we may predict with reason probabl that microlens will discov planet with mass like that of earth at a similar distanc from their star and with compar surfac temperatur said studi coauthor bohdan/ENTITY paczynski/ENTITY princeton/ENTITY univers/ENTITY so far the planet onli goe by and take about ten year to orbit it parent star a red/ENTITY dwarf/ENTITY a star that is smaller and much cooler than our own scientist say the new planet which is about five and a half time the mass of could either have a rocki core and a thin atmospher or be a small icega world like but in either case it veri larg orbit and cooler parent star make it a veri cold world
the predict surfac temperatur is ___ celsius ___ f which mean that should it have a rocki core the planet may more close resembl a massiv version of with a surfac of frozen liquid and gas otherwis the planet would be a liquid mass wrap in cloud of ice crystal and gas much like this is veri excit and import said professor michael bode from liverpool/ENTITY john/ENTITY moor/ENTITY univers/ENTITY a princip investig for the robonet project which help to collabor on the research this is the most earthlik planet we have discov to date in term of it mass and the distanc from it parent star most of the other planet that have been discov are either much more massiv much hotter or both
this is the third planet in two year that scientist have found use gravit microlens
in the past more than ___ planet outsid our solar system were found use a techniqu known as the radial/ENTITY veloc/ENTITY method this method observ a wobbl in star caus by the planet gravit effect
