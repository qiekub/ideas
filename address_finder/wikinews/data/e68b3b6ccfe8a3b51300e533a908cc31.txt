ds the first biographi of bob/ENTITY marley/ENTITY soul rebel natur mystic was written by you base upon your person experi with him and you have recent written a book about marley call the book of exodus how difficult is it to continu to mine his life is it difficult to come up with new angl
vg the origin biographi was written in a weekend and it was base upon my extens interview with him wherea the exodus book took two and a half year i must have been a year past deadlin becaus it kept on grow even i had to acknowledg it was a more matur work after i wrote the first one all these other peopl came out with book i read them and they were all good in their differ way but there was a stori that had not been told but that i had live so intens a deep stori that had shape my whole life it demand i write a book about it nobodi els has the experi and i still have that oompf
ds you were there with marley through that time when he realli caught on was it obvious to you then that there was someth amaz and uniqu happen
vg it was realli someth and it was huge but i didnt examin it then i believ in bob with everi fiber of my be but it was hard to realiz how everybodi in the world would get it in the end and just how tower a figur and endur he would prove to be he deserv everyth and more the role that he occupi is so central it would have been hard to envisag how huge he becam though
ds warhol factori photograph billi/ENTITY name/ENTITY onc told me he knew that what was go on was amaz but he never thought warhol would becom the entir fabric of the art world as he is now
vg especi in new york warhol was so associ with the punk scene
ds but marley has becom a fabric of sort
vg oh hes beyond the fabric of regga hes the fabric of the rebel spirit now everybodi just put on a littl red green and gold and they feel it identifi them as be there in the struggl even if it is someon fli to the hampton for the weekend they bring out marley to express the rebel aspect they dont want to complet lose
ds how do you defin punk
vg there are two thing first the aesthet harder faster louder but the second thing is what interest me more which was the rebel spirit and attitud that free spirit of punk that implicit sens of want to chang a system that is alway unfair wherev you are except for mayb in the netherland but it becom so commodifi
ds what is the commodifi version of punk sell
vg edgi and danger it is amaz you open the new york time and the free bit fall out and you get urban/ENTITY outfitt/ENTITY old/ENTITY navi/ENTITY with line of punk kiddi cloth kmart even i was tri to see what was so deepli punk about those cloth they were mayb more color or someth but they werent punk it like the swarovski/ENTITY crystal/ENTITY take on punk i mean pleas
ds that aesthet is everywher as though if one spike his hair he is punk
vg well the punk is in the heart to paraphras i was write about good/ENTITY charlott/ENTITY the/ENTITY polic/ENTITY they adopt the trap of punk they arent bad group but the punk aspect is more manifest by somebodi like manu/ENTITY chao/ENTITY hes one of the punkiest artist out there i can think of it an inclusionari spirit that is punk
ds your philosophi is that punk is not just music but also an aesthet that it can imbib anyth that it stand for chang and for chang a system let me give you a few name and you to tell me how you think they are or are not punk britney/ENTITY spear/ENTITY vg oh no shes not punk punk is not just about wear smeari black eyelin but some sens of engag that it in a nutshel she doesnt have that sens of engag she is societi dick/ENTITY cheney/ENTITY vg he is the essenc of babylonian old structur capit which is about greed and how much one can take for himself i could see capit that is mutual benefici such as i want a bigger custom base but they dont take a place i know well like jamaica i dont know if you have seen that documentari life/ENTITY and/ENTITY debt/ENTITY about how the inf squeez everyth out of jamaica but that a typic thing that happen instead of build these peopl up and pay them a live wage for their work where we could sell more to them we just want to suck everyth out of the place suck the sugar suck the labor and that is not veri punk it the opposit of punk that what dick cheney repres to me he tri to bring about chang but chang that just fatten his pocket it not think of the communiti and that what punk is about kany/ENTITY west/ENTITY vg he seem to be a posit forc in that sens i would file him slight under punk osama/ENTITY bin/ENTITY laden/ENTITY vg he think he is a punk but hes too destruct if i was sit in the madrassa in the desert chant the koran seven day a week id think yeah hes a punk but im not so i dont
ds is the definit of punk relat then hes a punk but not a vg have said that they would loath punk so i think we can safe say not a punk pete/ENTITY doherti/ENTITY vg oh yeah i think hes a punk hes a punk and he engag with the system in term of how a power a presenc hes becom he is the keith/ENTITY richard/ENTITY of his day
ds if punk is about chang then whi the maudlin sentiment over the close of s which at time turn into demon a homeless shelter
vg yeah and they had not paid their rent had they i side with the homeless shelter in a way except i thought the whole thing was ridicul becaus somebodi should have step in and bought it and paid it and fix it up in the sens there is no shrine they don think about the tourism do they i expect that of america now los angel just destroy the brown/ENTITY derbi/ENTITY and the modernist architectur that the thing about america there seem to be veri littl regard for legaci i think they should have kept cbgbs but i think that more cynic my student had a huge debat about it
ds i felt it was what it was at a certain moment but it wasnt that anymor they were charg eight dollar for a beer that not veri punk and that wasnt attract the punk crowd it was like peopl who move to the boweri becaus they think it so edgi but it realli a boulevard of glitter condo
vg nostalgi pour la boue nostalgia for the mud not all of them though patti smith anyway the spirit had move on to williamsburg they are flush out the artist manhattan is now a ghetto for the veri rich
ds where do you think new york cultur is go there are so few place on earth with such a larg concentr of creativ who meet and influenc each other but the citi is becom less afford and cleans of ani grit is there a place for punk in the manhattan of the futur
vg they are flush out the artist manhattan is now a ghetto for the veri rich when punk start it was in weird place place you broke into and that had never been use for show it was never in regular venu but now everi nook and cranni is a regular venu and it doesnt leav much space for the old punk spirit abc/ENTITY no/ENTITY rio/ENTITY i think they manag to work it in the system and there are place like the/ENTITY stone/ENTITY john/ENTITY zorn/ENTITY s place which has avantgard free form jazz he subsid that place so it remain a littl haven there are a few littl pocket but it has a lot do with the rent realist there load of stuff happen in place like brooklyn more than there seem to be in manhattan when i jam with the slit that happen at some afterhour thing in brooklyn in some warehous i rememb load of thing in funni place the first time i heard public enemi i was on the rooftop of a build
