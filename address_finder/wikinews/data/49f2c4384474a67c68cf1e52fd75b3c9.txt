sunday decemb _ ____ liber/ENTITY parti/ENTITY have retain both the bradfield and higgin seat in the hous of repres despit some predict a voter backlash after their recent leadership chang and split over environment polici
the seat were previous held by former opposit leader brendan nelson and former treasur peter costello respect
in higgin the victori candid was kelli/ENTITY odwyer/ENTITY ten candid contest this byelect though the govern labor/ENTITY parti/ENTITY did not field a candid
i think it send a clear messag to kevin rudd that they cannot take their voter for grant she said their voter will come to the liber parti if given an opportun candid dr clive hamilton was also happi with the result the green have achiev a vote of __ per cent or so which is easili the highest vote the green have score in a hous of repres elect dr hamilton said that mean about a quarter of the voter of higgin who onc vote labor or liber have decid to trust their vote to the green
hamilton told the australian broadcast corpor that ms odwyer will toe the parti line on climat chang
i think kelli odwyer will fit in perfect well with toni abbott sceptic liber parti he said i dont think she will realli take the climat chang messag to higgin so effect __ per cent of her voter are complet disenfranchis on the most import issu that concern them
the victori candid in bradfield was paul/ENTITY fletcher/ENTITY __ candid contest this byelect again without one from labor
my experi as i talk to peopl dure the campaign was that peopl were concern about privat health insur overdevelop econom manag and so on fletcher a former optus execut said climat chang came up as an issu but it wasnt the number one issu certain the liber parti need to have a respons on climat chang as our leader toni abbott has said but it is not the onli issu to campaign on
