Ã¢ngelo a chora et al are report in the journal/ENTITY of/ENTITY clinic/ENTITY investig/ENTITY this week that carbon/ENTITY monoxid/ENTITY co and the heme/ENTITY oxygenase_/ENTITY protein/ENTITY protect against the symptom of multipl/ENTITY sclerosi/ENTITY ms in the relat mous model of experiment/ENTITY autoimmun/ENTITY encephalomyel/ENTITY multipl sclerosi is a chronic inflammatori diseas that affect the central/ENTITY nervous/ENTITY system/ENTITY cns although mani patient are larg unaffect by their diseas ms can caus impair mobil and disabl in more sever case
the research group from the gulbenkian institut in use the eae mous model of ms to studi the effect of the heme oxygenase_ ho_ protein encod by the hmox_ gene knockout/ENTITY mice/ENTITY lack both copi of the gene not produc the show a more sever progress of the diseas compar to wildtyp mice have normal level of the protein the symptom of the diseas were revers when the ho_ protein express was induc use cobalt dure ms attack the bodi own immun/ENTITY system/ENTITY destroy the myelin/ENTITY sheath/ENTITY nerv/ENTITY cell/ENTITY in the brain and spinal cord pathogen t/ENTITY helper/ENTITY cell/ENTITY are trigger by antigenpres/ENTITY cell/ENTITY apc within the brain stem the diseas can cycl between attack relaps follow by remiss suggest that there is an under regulatori system the ho_ protein had been identifi previous as a possibl candid for a protect gene
ho_ degrad excess within the bodi act as the rate control step when under inflammatori condit the ho_ heme degrad pathway produc as product equal amount of free heme carbon monoxid and carbon monoxid was also shown to limit the effect of the diseas mice were expos to a high concentr of co for __ day within a chamber mice expos to co had limp tail but were more mobil than the mice in the control experi which display hind limb it is still unknown exact how carbon monoxid slow down the symptom of eae possibl through the mop up of free/ENTITY radic/ENTITY or through promot the bind of iron to heme decreas radic product
the experi found that ho_ did not affect the develop or function of regulatori/ENTITY t/ENTITY cell/ENTITY for a benefici effect ho_ need to be express in dendrit/ENTITY cell/ENTITY caus inhibit of mhcii/ENTITY protein/ENTITY involv in present antigen and inflammatori cytokin these experi open up new possibl for ms therapi involv the express of ho_ in suppress the develop of ms
the articl went onlin on the __th januari ____ and will be print in the journal of clinic investig in februari
