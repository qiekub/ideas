saturday januari _ ____ hypothet uneven ring of dust orbit tabbi star research with nasa spitzer and swift telescop as well as the belgian astrolab iri observatori estim the diamet of the dust particl to be within the rang found in dust disk orbit star and larger than particl typic of interstellar dust shown with a coupl of comet consist with studi suggest this possibl
on wednesday a team of over ___ scientist led by astronom tabetha/ENTITY boyajian/ENTITY announc the mysteri dimandrecov behavior of stellar object kic/ENTITY _______/ENTITY also call boyajian star or tabbi star is like to be due to cloud of colorwarp space dust and not a planet anoth star or as some astronom have hypothes a giant structur built by a distant civil
if a solid opaqu object like a megastructur was pass in front of the star it would block out light equal at all color dr boyajian told the press this is contrari to what we observ and in a separ statement dust is most like the reason whi the star light appear to dim and brighten the new data show that differ color of light are be block at differ intens therefor whatev is pass between us and the star is not opaqu as would be expect from a planet or alien megastructur
the research team analyz __ month of data collect by an array of groundbas telescop that cover mani wavelength of light the studi period last from march ____ to decemb ____ which includ a number of decreas in bright the first dip start on the night of thursday may __ a robot __inch telescop at fairborn/ENTITY observatori/ENTITY tabbi/ENTITY star/ENTITY lose bright by a dramat _ by friday confirm a predict the star would undergo it unusu dim event onc everi ___ day other major telescop project and citizen astronom confirm these find that dip was complex and continu through to the follow sunday after a brief rise in bright over the weekend it end a few day later with boyajian and fellow astronom and coauthor of the recent paper jason wright discuss the phenomena with the public via will we have a flurri of dip to come stay tune the new data show that differ color of light are be block at differ intens therefor whatev is pass between us and the star is not opaqu dr tabetha boyajian of the univers of louisiana
tabbi star went through a lot of veri strang dim event that got up to __ dimmer dure the kepler mission and sinc then weve been eager await anoth dip and the reason that weve been wait for that is that whatev is caus the star to get dimmer will leav a spectral fingerprint behind said dr jason wright of pennsylvania/ENTITY state/ENTITY univers/ENTITY after the may event now a coauthor of the current work so if it a lot of dust between us and the star that pass by it should block more blue light than red light if there gas in that dust that gas should absorb veri specif wavelength so weve been eager to see one of these chang these dip in the star so we can take the spectra he also address space fan at the time via twitter url star is dip this is not a drill astro tweep on telescop in the next __ hour spectra pleas
the primari mission of the kepler project monitor more than ______ star with the primari goal of detect if a star get dimmer but then recov a planet may have pass in front of it but tabbi star has shown someth els an exoplanet can caus it sun to dim by perhap _ and not for veri long some of tabbi dip have been this mild but other have hit __ and last week it also tend to recov onli partial slowli show a net dim over the year artist impress of wasp__ eat a hot/ENTITY jupit/ENTITY wasp/ENTITY __/ENTITY b/ENTITY the hottest known one hypothesi for kic _______ is that it recent ate a larg planet like this the plethora of hypothes behind tabbi star has made it a favorit among space fan and both profession and amateur astronom space dust was one of the mani hypothes explan but if that the reason it origin was and remain a mysteri with stargaz specul mani giant comet could be on ellipt orbit or break up in front of it or the dip in bright could be aftereffect of the star consum/ENTITY a/ENTITY planet/ENTITY some even hypothes alien civil might have been harvest the sun energi use a dyson/ENTITY sphere/ENTITY search/ENTITY for/ENTITY extraterrestri/ENTITY intellig/ENTITY seti devot some observ time to tabbi star in the fall of ____ as part of the breakthrough/ENTITY listen/ENTITY project no radio or laser puls signal were detect
this latest research rule out alien megastructur but it rais the plausibl of other phenomena be behind the dim said dr wright there are model involv circumstellar materi like exocomet which were boyajian team origin hypothesi which seem to be consist with the data we have some astronom favor the idea that noth is block the star that it just get dimmer on it own and this also is consist with this summer data
this studi is a departur from mani previous work in that it reli heavili on the work of citizen scientist volunt who help examin the great quantiti of data produc by nasa kepler mission the followup observ after the kepler project were fund by a ______ to continu monitor tabbi star the unusu behavior of tabbi star was discov in ____ by volunt for the planet/ENTITY hunter/ENTITY citizen scienc project which was implement to search for planet in the kepler data
it excit i am so appreci of all of the peopl who have contribut to this in the past year the citizen scientist and profession astronom it quit humbl to have all of these peopl contribut in various way to help figur it out dr boyajian said in a statement
