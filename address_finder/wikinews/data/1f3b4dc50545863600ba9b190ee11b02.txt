thursday januari __ ____
in find publish wednesday in the scientif journal a team of scientist from the chines/ENTITY academi/ENTITY of/ENTITY scienc/ENTITY have announc the firstev clone of a primat from postembryon cell name two macaqu monkey they use somat/ENTITY cell/ENTITY nuclear/ENTITY transfer/ENTITY the same method that was use to creat dolli/ENTITY the/ENTITY sheep/ENTITY in ____
in somat cell nuclear transfer scientist remov the which is the organell that contain the from an unfertil or egg cell and implant the nucleus from a somat/ENTITY cell/ENTITY or nonreproduct cell into that ovum the ovum is then stimul and develop in the normal way grow into a whole organ that has the same nuclear dna as the donor organ though it will have all of the ovum and other cellular machineri clone like these have been describ as ident twin to their donor but younger both clone are macaqu like the one pictur
the scientist implant __ into surrog mother monkey result in six pregnanc two of which produc live anim the young clone were name zhong/ENTITY zhong/ENTITY and/ENTITY hua/ENTITY hua/ENTITY both deriv from the chineselanguag word for the chines peopl they are both cynomolgus/ENTITY monkey/ENTITY or crabeat macaqu macaca fasciculari the scientist also attempt to clone macaqu use nuclei from adult donor they implant __ surrog result in __ pregnanc but there were still onli two infant macaqu and they die soon after birth the base team that creat dolli the sheep in ____ requir ___ attempt and produc onli one lamb
general the older the donor organ the more difficult it is to get the dna from the harvest nucleus to reactiv the gene that allow the clone organ to grow previous effort to clone rhesus/ENTITY monkey/ENTITY macaca mulatta use embryon/ENTITY donor/ENTITY cell/ENTITY have been success but the current attempt use signific older donor fetal fibroblast/ENTITY cell/ENTITY which are key cell in connect tissu and adult monkey cumulus/ENTITY cell/ENTITY were excit extrem excit said studi coauthor mume/ENTITY poo/ENTITY this is realli i think a breakthrough for biomedicin he went on to say that the clone monkey could be use as test subject for the studi of neurolog diseas such as s primat are alreadi a popular model/ENTITY organ/ENTITY for neurolog studi in the unit state for exampl nonhuman primat are use in less than __ of all anim experi most of them involv neurosci and macaqu in particular are a wellestablish anim model of which caus heart/ENTITY diseas/ENTITY i think it a veri excit landmark it a major advanc agre reproduct biologist dieter eg of columbia/ENTITY univers/ENTITY it should be possibl to make model of human diseas in those monkey and studi those and then attempt to cure it
about __ of the laboratori anim use in the unit state are rodent although the first clone mous was born in ____ clone mice are not current common in laboratori set this may be becaus produc inbr mous line is still relat effect
although the announc rais enthusiasm from research it also drew caution from clone one individu in the imag of anoth realli sort of demean the signific of us as individu say harvard medic school dr georg daley speak specif of clone human there a certain sort of gut sens that it violat sort of natur norm while mume poo conced it is now theoret possibl to clone a human he say his lab has no plan to do so
although somat cell nuclear transfer was use success in amphibian as earli as ____ get it to work in mammal took much longer dolli the first clone mammal was born in ____ team have been tri to clone monkey for decad but primat dna is notori difficult to work with the trick is we choos the right chemic to turn on these gene we transfer into the egg mume poo told the press so that what we did differ i think that the key one of the agent use to treat the ova was messeng rna from the human
