whi do you want to be presid
my name is frank mcenulti and i am run as an independ candid for presid of the unit state in ____ crazi right well mayb but i am just way too fed up with how the two major parti are run or should i say ruin polit in this countri and i feel the need to tri and do someth about it
ive notic over the past sever year that most of the polit ad are push a parti rather than idea or an individu vote for me im a republican or vote for me im a democrat is all one seem to hear ani more what do these peopl stand for noth until the parti tell them to or els they get cut off from the fountain of money
do these candid have independ thought mayb but they never voic them in public becaus it might not be in line with parti doctrin
do they ever vote for a bill law or polici becaus it is the right thing to do for the countri onli if the parti tell them it is okay to do so
usual if a republican introduc a piec of legisl it must be wrong per the democrat becaus the democrat didnt come up with it
usual if a democrat introduc a piec of legisl it must be wrong per the republican becaus the republican didnt come up with it
what wrong with just work togeth to do what is right for the countri regardless of what parti you are affili with
if your as disillus with how the polit process seem to be work as i am let get togeth and make them see how upset we are none of us can do it by ourselv but if enough of us band togeth we can and will make them sit up and take notic
pleas visit my websit at url to see where i stand on a lot of today import issu and pass this email along to all your famili member and friend cowork and everyon els you know
togeth we will make a differ becaus
anyth is possibl in america
have you ever run for polit offic befor presid senat congress citi councillor school truste etc have you ever been a member of a polit parti other than the one your current in
no i havent run for befor yes for year i was a member of the republican parti back when it believ in fiscal respons and smaller govern for the last __ year i was regist as an independ and i recent becam a member of the new/ENTITY american/ENTITY independ/ENTITY parti/ENTITY have you ever campaign for anoth polit candid
what is your current job
my current job is presid and cfo for a group of small privat own compani although i have manag compani that have been involv in a wide cross section of differ industri the vast major of my work experi has been in various sector of the real estat industri
what skill or idea do you bring from this posit or previous posit that will benefit the oval offic
dure my career i have been call on mani time to straighten out problem and get thing move in the right direct i am a problem solver who can make the tough decis to get thing done and back on track the problem with almost all politician these day is that they are politician and onli care about what they need to do to win the next elect what this countri need are statesmen who will look at the big pictur and do what is right for all american you dont make everyon happi do that the same as you cant alway make everyon happi in your busi but if you keep the longterm view it will turn out better for all concern and make for a stronger more vibrant countri that benefit everyon
obvious the next american presid and his or her administr will face mani divers issu but if you were to narrow identifi the three most import issu what would they be how will you address these issu
first the biggest problem face us now and for generat to come is our depend on foreign sourc of oil and oil in general
we need to immedi start a manhattan project for energi independ we put a man on the moon back in the dark age of technolog and i firm believ that we have the brain power to come up with solut to the world energi problem if onli we appli ourselv and our resourc to the task we are quick on our way toward spend _____________ that a trillion of your tax dollar on the war in iraq if that money had instead been point toward new research and develop into fuel cell hydrogen solar wind and other technolog i believ we would alreadi be well on our way to major breakthrough in renew and altern energi solut
the world and the unit state would be much better off if we werent all reli on a small region of the world for the lifeblood of our economi the onli way to bring the price of oil down is to make it less valuabl and the onli way to do that is to develop altern energi sourc that can replac oil in everyday life not onli would this be good for the countri and for the futur but it would also go a long way to reduc greenhous gas emiss
for that reason i am propos the follow energi plan for the unit state and the world in the follow _ step
short term conserv and altern power
five to thirti year a strong nuclear program
long term we need new technolog a manhattan project for energi independ
pleas see my websit at for more detail on this and other polici my administr will be follow
second the next biggest problem face us now and for generat to come is our fiscal irrespons
there are fewer topic concern our current polit landscap that get me more upset than the fiscal irrespons of our congress and presid as presid i promis to veto ani and all bill that includ the barrel of pork as discuss below if we dont get our countri back on a foot of fiscal respons soon we are go to leav a bankrupt second level economi to our children and grandchildren the presid is our leader and he need to act like one and do what is right for the countri now and in the futur
under the fiscal restraint of the republican our deficit has balloon and spend has increas even ignor the war in iraq at a greater pace than at almost ani time in the histori of our countri there was the hope and as we were promis by the democrat dure the last congression elect that they would show some fiscal restraint and get the countri back on a path of fiscal respons but the current congress has shown they can even outspend the spendthrift republican without a truli independ presid our spend will never go down as they will alway be tri to buy vote for the parti
third the next biggest problem face us now is illeg immigr
the fact are simpl the presid and his administr have conspir with the larg busi and agricultur interest in our countri to artifici depress and holddown wage they have done this at a tremend cost to all lawabid taxpay american citizen and it need to stop now it is also in the process of bankrupt a larg number of our state counti and citi becaus of the cost of deal with illeg immigr and their famili if the illeg immigr problem had not occur most state and local govern would be in a financ surplus situat and wage across the board for entri level job would be higher
the problem of illeg immigr actual has a veri simpl solut start enforc the penalti against the hire of illeg immigr and you will remov the major attract that draw peopl to this countri illeg job without job and the prospect of a much better life the vast major of peopl will stay home
as presid i would do one thing to ensur that this situat doesnt happen again i would make sure our law are enforc
first i would instruct all agenc under my jurisdict to strict enforc and appli the rule against hire illeg immigr worker
second i would direct that all instanc of hire of illeg alien be subject to penalti by jail time real jail time not a countri club jail it real simpl for an employ to pay a fine and move on that just a cost of do busi it not so simpl to ignor the threat of real jail time in a real crimin jail no one want to face that prospect
third there would be no feder fund benefit program avail to illeg immigr further remov incent to come here illeg
fourth i believ we need to chang the constitut so that onli those born of american citizen becom citizen of this countri upon birth the founder of our countri could and would have never envis the fact that there are hundr of thousand of babi be born each year in unit state hospit sole so their parent can use their anchor babi as an excus to demand to stay here and take benefit from the rest of us
it realli that simpl if the law are enforc and there arent ani job or free govern benefit for illeg alien then there will be no reason for them to sneak across the border and come here
campaign for the american presid is one of the most expens exercis in the world how do you deal with the cost and fundrais
the internet is a wonder vehicl for get the word out about my campaign the internet is the base and then i reli on individu to tell those they know and befor long you build up a real snowbal effect the vast major of the money spent by the major candid is a complet wast of money when was the last time that someon listen to an entir polit campaign ad didnt hang up on a comput generat phone call or actual read the campaign literatur that was receiv in the mail befor tear it up unfortun today major parti polit believ in spend vast quantiti of money but rare spend it smart sound like how our govern oper as well
what are youwer you look for in a run mate
i will be look for someon who is smart want what is best for all american is a moder a fiscal conserv and will put forth the time and effort to run in a real campaign i also believ that my run mate need to be a busi person becaus the govern is a busi and need to run more like one im not worri about be outsid in the washington scene becaus i believ that gridlock is good for the follow reason if there is gridlock then onli legisl that make sens for all american and benefit the vast major of all american will get pass weve got hundr of thousand of law we dont need new one everi day
can you win the ____ presidenti elect
i am will to admit that my chanc of win the ____ presidenti elect are slight but there is still a chanc for the simpl reason that i do not see a candid on either the republican or democrat side who is look to do what is best for all american and i strong believ that most american are still look for that person to lead them as their presid
can ani third parti or independ candid ever win
yes i believ the odd of a third parti or independ candid improv with everi presidenti elect peopl are becom more and more frustrat with what they perceiv as a complet lack of interest on the part of politician includ their presid with what is best of the countri the more nois the third parti and independ candid make the more peopl will realiz there is anoth choic and the better their chanc becom of win the white hous
if you cant make it into the oval offic who would you prefer see take the presid
none of the current candid from the two major parti are suitabl to be presid at this time right now and i have heard this from a lot a peopl it will be a choic of hold your nose and vote for who you think might do the least amount of damag none of the major candid remain who have a chanc per the newspap have ani desir to do what is right for america in the longterm and do what is right for all american and not just what will get their parti member elect and reelect hard unpopular decis need to be made to get our countri back on a decent track and no politician from a major parti will take that track
what should the american peopl keep in mind when head to the poll this novemb
that this is your countri and there are option just becaus the democrat have this person and the republican have that person doesnt mean there isnt someon els better out there a presidenti elect is alway import and this one is more import than most recent one due to our current fiscal energi and other troubl do a littl work see who is truli best for america and then vote that way the person may not win but if enough peopl do this a messag will get sent that even the major parti will have to listen to eventu
