iain macdonald how are you do today
petro tzomaka we are cope were look at number and digit and how theyr tear us apart
im has slavish pursuit of freemarket capit been the caus of europ and particular greec econom woe how given the soviet/ENTITY collaps/ENTITY be communist in name onli would your vision of a communist system have been better for the major of citizen
pt given current circumst i think the main goal should be to nationalis mean of product and servic such as bank but under democrat control by union and local council where it effect local economi and reelect local repres where need
there is a necess for a plan economi but one control not by bureaucraci but by the peopl particip in it
im for right or for wrong we have now reach a situat where greec is on the brink of an intern bailout if you were given power tomorrow what step would you take immedi to get greec back on track
pt we would immedi nationalis the bank we would refus to pay the bond which were call upon dure this time renationalis privatis industri and invest in such a plan economi
basic we would refus to pay debt creat by the bank on our govern
petro then gave some statist on greek defenc expenditur he state that greec is the _thin the world in such expenditur but has onli the __thhighest combin with the __rd highest popul count
im pick up on your comment about defens expenditur is that expenditur a result of a perceiv/ENTITY threat/ENTITY and if so is this realli an issu or a creation of a problem where there isnt one
pt there has alway been tension between the govern of greec and turkey some creat by attempt to cover mistak by both side it is no coincid that both are in dire strait financi
it is an artifici thing creat by the govern of cours these thing can escal both greec and turkey have a polici of arm buildup we recent had the sledgehamm/ENTITY controversi/ENTITY in turkey where they plan to creat incid within greec in an effort to seiz power
also mani highrank armi offic have been prosecut in turkey for tri to seiz power in a coup
im whi do you oppos the current auster measur what has the govern in your view got so wrong
pt the govern in it effort to pay back bank and in fact to pay back interest on loan has alreadi paid in some case twice the origin loan at high interest rate
theyr tri to grab as much money as they can and we know for a fact that also on the order of the greek capitalist class
they are reduc the worker right for more money and this actual lead to poverti greec will be in guarante recess for two year and hope then to creat a __ gdp rise that will be veri hard
we know from a varieti of statist that the work class will be made to pay around __ of the current gdp
consum will go to standstil so that in two year time debt will rise from ___ of current gdp to ___ gdp and peopl will suffer we know all the loan just like the previous loan will be siphon off by busi and will not go into greek coffer it will go instead to line the pocket of big busi
im i have heard that peopl in greec are upset that the euro has weaken greec econom posit as the s low valu actual encourag spend by foreign what step would a socialist govern take to encourag new spend in greec by both foreign tourist and investor
pt a socialist govern could actual work if other economi and other peopl would follow greec step greec would then be a selfsuffici economi and not need these invest of cours we onc had these invest through the tourism industri and they didnt work
this is whether with the new currenc of the euro or the old the govern is serious think of relaps right now which would be a disast becaus it would be so devalu it would possibl even go into a tailspin of devalu
the possibl are grossli underestim in greec and not enough invest are made in these possibl
tourism is the main industri in greec becaus there is littl cost need in invest and it doesnt need a veri big infrastructur
ani infrastructur that was need has been left to abandon by both the last two govern the panhellen socialist movement and new democraci a visitor can see and understand this by the shape ship and ferri are in and the way facil are lack
im how do you respond to the assert that democraci is the leastworst of all the polit system tri would the greek communist accept a multiparti system where some parti would be strident advoc freemarket econom
pt one of the difficulti peopl face when seek answer about a better polit system is the blackandwhit approach of idea and name true democraci is a necessari principl but there are vast differ between eg a bourgeois democraci and a socialist democraci
also especi in greec the term communist is use by mani in the left it almost a synonym the major of the left would strong disagre with a oneparti model the leadership what erron most peopl call communist would probabl desir such a system but noon would advoc such a demand today the onli polit forc that everyon in the left agre should be ban are those of the ultraright with racist and fascist agenda and this becaus they stand against the principl of democraci in ani case as we can see howev throughout europ and in histori the capitalist system need such alli especi in time of crisi in greec for instanc the ultraright populist lao popular/ENTITY orthodox/ENTITY ralli/ENTITY parti has proven itself an invalu alli of pasok panhellen socialist movement in support the most vicious antilabour measur suppress of worker right even a noquestionsask polici of currenc deposit that would favor moneylaund for illeg trade such as narcot or human traffick in the mean time it tri to put the blame for the crisi caus by the financi system on scapegoat such as the immigr and refuge popul
if peopl had a fair and unbias view of what a plan economi under democrat control could offer i believ that freemarket advoc would be margin by the work class intern with no call for suppress which can lead to danger path
im you mention in your email to me that the kke doe not cooper with the rest of the nation leftw communiti whi is this doe this split confus potenti voter about who to support
pt unfortun the undemocrat stalinist tradit and practic of the kke are deeplyroot in the greek cp communist parti one has onli to read the analysi of their last congress to see this therefor the kke cannot stand in coalit as an equal to other opinion the current leadership of the kke not onli refus to collabor with the rest of the left but treat it as a class enemi on the pretext that the largest faction in the syriza coalit vote for the maastricht/ENTITY treati/ENTITY this becam more obvious dure the decemb ____ upris where it denounc the youth as agent provocateur that seak to destabil the countri manipul the mass to violenc and that syriza was harbor vandal and crimin element earn shame congratul from the govern and the farright also the kke through it union front pame refus to collabor with other union in industri action except general strike and then alway with separ demonstr and ralli this behaviour howev has not gone unnot by the rankandfil member and there is sizabl discont with this hardlin approach the onli thing that hold them is tradit strict parti disciplin and the occasion weak of syriza in term of less milit and more reformist posit project by synaspismo in both case we expect to see develop that will answer to the indeedconfus public that doe not give mass support to the left most becaus of disappoint over sectarian lack of milit and larger demand rather than disagr on principl protest in greec over propos budget cut may _ ____
