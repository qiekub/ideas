in find publish tuesday in astronomi/ENTITY and/ENTITY astrophys/ENTITY a team of scientist led by ian boutl at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY exet/ENTITY have creat success simul of two possibl atmospher of proxima/ENTITY b/ENTITY proxima/ENTITY centauri/ENTITY one a simpl atmospher of nitrogen ting with carbon dioxid and anoth an earthlik/ENTITY mix/ENTITY of/ENTITY gase/ENTITY they found it possibl that liquid water a prerequisit for life as we know it might exist on part of the planet artist represent of proxima b as an arid but not waterless rocki exoplanet
the univers of exet lead exoplanet model dr nathan mayn in remark to said if and it is a huge if the composit of the atmospher was earthlik then we show the planet could inde support temperatur which would allow liquid water on the surfac in anoth statement he emphas research could also exploit this to hope improv our understand of how our own climat has and will evolv
proxima b is believ rough earthsiz and in it solar system habit/ENTITY zone/ENTITY mean it would have similar graviti to earth and at least the possibl of liquid water the exoplanet was discov in august ____ about __ light/ENTITY year/ENTITY s from earth last year put out a statement express doubt that the planet could have an atmospher in the sens that most of us understand it consid the host star age and the planet proxim to it host star the scientist expect that proxima b is subject to torrent of and extrem radiat from superflar occur rough everi two hour
coauthor dr jame manner said one of the main featur that distinguish this planet from earth is that the light from it star is most in the near these frequenc of light interact much more strong with water vapour and carbon dioxid in the atmospher which affect the climat that emerg in our model
this new model allow scientist to evalu the effect of proxima bs possibl orbit and like exposur to radiat and solar/ENTITY flare/ENTITY from it red/ENTITY dwarf/ENTITY sun on two type of atmospher the specif of proxima bs orbit are not yet establish it might rotat around it axi quick the way earth doe or it might be tidal/ENTITY lock/ENTITY to it sun with one side of the planet alway lit and the other alway dark it might have a nearcircular orbit or an ellipt one all these variat would have differ effect on the flow of ani gase over it surfac the model describ in this paper review two possibl orbit one tidal lock and one model after with a slowrot three day per year
the team use the met/ENTITY offic/ENTITY unifi/ENTITY model/ENTITY to produc the simul
