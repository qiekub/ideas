nm i gain more self confid i gain an abil to work in sale in the first cours i gain the abil to quiet my mind and to just exist in the univers i think these same benefit are there today for new peopl but do i think they are worth the price charg or year of one life given no i do not last i check to do all of scientolog and make it to the top of the bridg oper thetan _ it would cost approxim ______ in the old day you could sign a contract for up to a billion year and get those servic at no cost but to my knowledg that is not the type of counsel staff are get now and if you did leav befor your particular contract was over you will receiv what is call a freeload bill a total of all the servic that you receiv in exchang for your work for them the current and past food and pay situat for staff member is below the illeg worker in this countri

i experienc sever level of cognit disson while in scientolog they say church on the door but the day to day oper are not those of a church those contrari thought were assuag for year becaus of the hubbard polici religion ____ wherein he state someth like we are a religion for account and attorney noth about our daili oper will chang that plus the line that i was often given and gave to other new to the church it not a faith it is an appli religi philosophi nondenomin in natur you can still belong to your own church and be a scientolog
that held my discomfort togeth until year later i read the messian program wherein hubbard laid out the step to make himself the next messiah for planet earth
anoth cognit disson was whi are we attempt to destroy and take over the entir field of mental health if we are a church well the same answer we arent realli a church
when lrh l ron hubbard himself wrote to me that he wish he had never gone the church rout at all it made me happi and eras the tension of the cognit disson
whi were the price so high if we were suppos to clear the planet and help make the world a better place then whi did we charg so much veri few peopl could afford that level of money and still surviv and rais a famili

wn dure the recount in the book of your mental breakdown you cite your husband and famili as key factor in help and support you what els or who els what other factor have help you recov from your mental break after disengag from scientolog
nm the other factor that help were that i did have a lot of friend who were not and had never been scientologist so i could hang with them and the subject would never come up therebi not trigger me back to scientolog languag or way of life
i also havehad a deep faith in god and an intern strength that made me pull my way out of the intermitt hell that last for year i knew this was life or death there were simpli peopl or place i could not be around

wn how do you think scientolog manag can improv the way it conduct it oper if you were the head of the organ what would you do differ what would you chang about scientolog practic
nm if i were the head of scientolog manag at this time i would strip it back to basic stop all human abus and human right abus and then have an open forum as to whether it want to be a church or want to be a self help group church ask for tith base on your incom a self help group has fix price for it counsel and servic
scientolog now has fix donat the weirdest oxymoron i have ever heard wn look back on your experi in scientolog you describ sever instanc in the book where you consid leav the organ or at least leav the sea org most notabl when you were order into the rehabilit/ENTITY project/ENTITY forc/ENTITY while you were pregnant pp ____ whi did you choos to stay

the peopl who had left befor us they becom non person and you have no idea where they went i want to leav without be put on the shun list which we eventu were abl to do that allow us to get help from other friend who had previous left the sea org but not scientolog
wn in the appendix of the book you refer and discuss the/ENTITY lucif/ENTITY effect/ENTITY philip/ENTITY zimbardo/ENTITY you cite how zimbardo isol _ social process that greas the slipperi slope of evil and acknowledg i found myself in all of these seven step to a greater or lesser degre in hindsight i can see each on of these point were present in the appl barrel of scientolog that i live through which of zimbardo step were most applic to your experi in scientolog know what you know now from the knowledg in zimbardo book how would you approach this differ in the futur if place in a similar situat again
nm the step for me was mindless take the first step there was no internet back then book against scientolog had either been remov from the librari or never been allow to be print the first class i took when i left scientolog was call critic think if i had taken that cours prior to scientolog i doubt i would have mindless taken that first step

wn do you have ani thought or advic for other either curious to find out more inform about scientolog or those seek to leav the organ
nm if you are think about join stick to the internet for a while a long while they have their own websit so you can see both side
for those seek to leav the sea organ just get up and walk out if they touch you you have a million dollar lawsuit but how to get the inform insid to you
