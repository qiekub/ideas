in light of recent event van canto member and founder stefan schmidt has given the band first interview in all previous interview be in wikinew now exclus bring you that interview below
on the earli day
how did you decid on the concept for the band
after the split of my former band jester funer i want to do someth vocal orient with a heroic attitud it wasnt plan to leav out all instrument in the begin it was an idea develop in the studio turn out to work great
are there ani similar band you could say inspir you or was it an origin idea
we are play melod metal so my inspir as a compos can be found in blind/ENTITY guardian/ENTITY and nightwish has alway been a great influenc for me too i dont listen to mani a capella band though there a german a capella band call the wise/ENTITY guy/ENTITY which i like but it and doesnt have to do much with our style of sing or perform combin the metal style with the perform style a capella is the origin part of the idea
in the music world as with all aspect of life new or rare idea often meet with difficulti how hard was it to get peopl to take you serious at first
it wasnt that hard becaus we did not do much for it we just present our idea and mani peopl like it some other didnt we dont put much time in convinc peopl start their argument with you dont use guitar this is no metal i think everyon who take the time to listen to our song or to visit us perform live can see that we realli love metal music and love to sing
befor you got your world sign you chang drummer is the previous drummer still involv in ani way with the band
yes strilli is still a friend of the band van canto first was plan as a studio project among friend we didnt expect it to turn out that success so strilli join the band for record and the video shoot although he had i think _ or _ band at that time when van canto seem to demand more time he decid to focus on other project it was not a problem for us becaus he told us earli and still manag to play all show with us until we had our new drummer
how did you select his replac
bastian is my long time band mate sinc __ year now we play togeth in all our band onli interrupt by the first van canto year when he live in china for one year after he return he was the first and onli choic to follow up strilli
when a storm to come was first releas did you expect the rapid success you subsequ receiv
to be honest from time to time we hope it but didnt expect it if you put that much time in a person hobbi and you notic that the result the first song sound realli great of cours you hope that other peopl like it as well but the fact that we receiv that much posit feedback in shortest time without ani support from a compani or manag make us veri happi it show that metal still work there are thousand of peopl out there wait for new music fanzin author work hour and hour on review and interview without get ani money for it it unbeliev great
how did you come to be select for the nightwish tour at such an earli stage in the band career how did they discov you
we got in touch with our current record compani in april ____ they manag to get in contact with the book compani of the on a dark winter nightperform so we werent actual chosen by nightwish themselv and it was onli for two show but nevertheless this was great
do you feel be associ with them has given or will give your popular a boost
of cours we play in front of _____ peopl within __ hour and everi magazin was there to see the first show of the new nightwish singer in germani this was a great experi for us and the audienc welcom us veri kind
how easi or hard was it to get your world record deal did you see a lot of reject beforehand or was it fair straightforward have by then shown the industri you were serious
unlik the approach we chose with our former band we didnt contact ani record compani with our selfproduc debut but manag everyth on our own so this time the record compani contact us after van canto was recogn in the internet
what about your first video for the mission how has that gone down with the industri
we did this on our own as well a friend of our did all the write cut and effect we onli had to pay a cameraman a light technican and a makeup artist for __ hour it was great to see how mani profession peopl have fun do their work and not demand thousand of euro of a new form band
on the new album
are thing on track for the record of the new album
yes everyth work fine we record drum in novemb and januari and will record all voic in march
when do you expect it to be releas
that up to the record compani i think it will be releas in summer so that the wacken crowd can sing out the new song
can you give us an idea of what to expect from the new materi
if you do someth new you dont have ani refer on how to sound we notic mani thing in the year after the record of a storm to come we now better know which word and syllabl sound good in which context of the song
so i think our bass voic will be more bass our guitar voic will be more guitar and so on from the songwrit point of view we are still in the melod metal genr what we call hero metal we will also do some cover
what it like work with charli bauerfeind
great hes a great guy with a veri high music understand have work with blind guardian he definit know how to push voic and mani of them in the right direct
do you expect to releas ani singl this time round will there be anoth music video
it too earli to tell we will first finish the record and then see what we can do around the song
do you anticip compar success with this album
we wait for noth but are thank for everyth happen so far and everyth that is about to happen let see
on wacken open air
there are a lot of veri big name announc for wacken as usual do you feel daunt by this
not daunt but realli exit if we can realli manag to shake hand with iron maiden im sure not be abl to speak one comprehens word haha but i guess everi band play on this year wacken will tri to shake hand with them so i better not too disappoint if it doesnt work out
what about in term of style wacken is known for the varieti but your music is the most unusu and amongst the lightest at the festiv is that a worri for you what sort of reaction do you expect
on everi festiv we play so far peopl were first irrit then a littl bit amus and not later than the third song we play most of the peopl were enthusiast about our song i hope this will be the way it turn out to be in wacken
what are your opinion on the other act there are there ani you want to see yourselv
iron maiden of cours nightwish are there and im also look forward to the have ani of you ever been to wacken befor as a fan or fan
of cours i have been there ____ ____ ____ and ____
do you expect wacken to open up new opertun for you can we expect van canto at say festiv in the hmm we hope so we also have a great fan base in and tri to get over there in the summer to do some show
how long is your slot at wacken
we dont know yet
will we see more new materi than anyth or will you perform a mix
this depend on how long our slot is but i think the focus will be on the second album then
on the futur of metal
do you expect a capella metal to becom a more common genr
i dont know i think it would be great if other band tri out so we can share our experi and do not have to find out everyth on our own haha
do you expect other band to be influenc and encourag by your success
i hope so when we get mail from musician or metalband influenc by our style of songwrit our by the courag for do someth new we feel realli great i onli start play music becaus i was inspir by other band as a teenag it would be great if we could inspir other musician too
do you think the industri should be more accept of fresh or unusu idea
i think the term the industri is too general for that kind of question i think that today the chanc to get heard are better than __ year ago everybodi can produc an oksound album and put up a video in youtub and if it done well and the idea stick out the industri will contact the band which is their job actual
one subject that been in the news a lot recent is band complain they feel exploit andor by their record label have you found this yourself
we all had bad experi with former band and former record label but most of these label have been one or twomancompani that didnt have much money to invest that whi we decid to do everyth on our own until we get a partner that is abl to do all the thing we do onli better
anoth common complaint is about illeg download kill the indutri what your opinion on that
illeg download is not onli kill the industri but also the band behind you cant earn much money with music today so of cours im not happi when i read a comment under our youtub video say who can rip me the record where can i download it i think we offer mani possibl for peopl who just want to check out one song we have the youtub video we have a stream player on our websit and you can find lot of live bootleg in the web so if you realli like the music you should buy a cd to give us the possibl to continu
but i think in metal most peopl act this way they realli buy cds becaus they like to own the cover the booklet and everyth it ok for us
what trend do you think we will see in metal over the next decad
i dont know and that the interest part of it metal has been declar be dead about ____ time and everi year there are new band with new idea great musician and lot of peopl listen i think there is much more to come
what advic do you have for artist of ani genr strugl to find accept from the industri
i dont feel i am in the posit of give advic we had a good idea work hard on it and were a littl bit lucki final perhap it the most import thing to make music becaus you like it not becaus you are expect someth all van canto member have been play in metal band for about __ or __ year and now it seem as if peopl start to recogn us even if they hadnt im sure that i would have continu play metal becaus i like it it a veri import part of myself so i dont wast a thought on leav that part away
