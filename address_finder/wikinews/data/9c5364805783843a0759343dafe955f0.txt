the interview dri buytaert talk to drupal communiti member at fosdem ____
on fosdem
wikinew how import is an event like fosdem for yourself and for the drupal communiti
dri buytaert i think it more import for the drupal communiti than for me person it is import becaus we work togeth day and night through mail list fora etc and when you meet each other facetofac you can understand one and anoth better it give more depth to your relationship it also import as a forum were mani idea can be discuss in a shorter time with the growth of drupal the communiti has grown and even for me it has becom imposs to follow all communic all forum post etc so it is also a way to filter new idea
wn do you go and visit other project as well
db normal i would ive been come here for seven year from start to finish but this year im onli here today and pure for the drupal devroom my job is to be present in the corridor to chat with peopl to do network and to connect peopl so fosdem is import to share inform to improv our relationship and third to promot drupal drupal is both an endus product and a framework for develop and the latter is certain a direct in which id like to see drupal grow more
on drupal wn can you give some exampl of websit that use drupal
db in belgium studio/ENTITY brussel/ENTITY donna both radio station ed intern you have for exampl amnesti/ENTITY intern/ENTITY but it rang from ozzi/ENTITY osbourn/ENTITY s to britney/ENTITY spear/ENTITY site also a lot of univers oh and zattevriendenb in belgium
wn wow it must be everywher if it rang from britney to ozzi tell me how has your role chang over the year
db my role has chang a lot at first i did everyth myself from the first to the last thing i wrote everi letter of code i manag the infrastructur i did sourc/ENTITY control/ENTITY public relat etc today there is a team of thousand of peopl who write the code and a lot more who work for exampl on the infrastructur there is a group of peopl concern with pr and market etc nowaday i write littl code myself but i continu to review a lot of code give yes no or yes but answer so ive becom more of a code review
we have found the drupal associ a belgiumbas nonprofit organis which aim to do promot organis of thing like confer etc the organis take on a lot of these task there are eight or nine director so it has realli becom a bigger organis that oper and develop drupal it also intern it base in belgium but there are onli two belgian director i think
wn do you think drupal is import for softwar in belgium countri like have a big softwar industri but we dont
db drupal was creat in belgium but it has becom realli intern most contribut come from the unit state now i think there are a few other open sourc project from belgium mayb not on the same size scale but still there are definit some project the fact that we organis the largest open sourc confer in europ show that there is a live interest wn look at your new startup acquia there are some peopl in the drupal communiti who are concern that your combin your leadership role with that of acquia you could have done like jimmi/ENTITY wale/ENTITY who start and took a step back from db i admit that combin these posit complic matter both for myself as for acquia but i have alway fought hard for what the drupal communiti has achiev the associ still has the right to use the domain name and such acquia will not have special privileg i have alway fought hard to keep the play field open
of cours we will be a major player simpli becaus of the money and there are some high visibl peopl involv but if we do thing with which the communiti doe not agre we will not forc them that built into our corpor dna we want to be seen as the best thing that ever happen to the drupal communiti our goal is to work togeth close im glad to see that the communiti has faith in us there are a number of import peopl from the communiti in our compani they will not sudden turn to the evil side they know better than anyon els what live in the communiti open and transpar are veri import peopl will simpli have to give us a chanc
wn if i listen to some communiti member i get the impress that they trust you and that they believ it will be all right
db it will be like that of cours there are a number of challeng but i have full confid i will do everyth to make the communiti succeed and if a problem aris then well organis ourselv were veri good at that
wn on the other hand you have to satisfi your investor they have invest heavili and they will want someth in return how will you generat revenu from your free softwar product
db our busi plan is to creat drupal distribut similar to what red/ENTITY hat/ENTITY did for well produc distribut that work on the platform of the client a second thing will be support say you instal drupal and someth goe wrong who are you gonna call we want to make drupal grow and get bigger by bring it to organis who dont possess such expertis apart from packag and support a third thing will be network servic servic you offer through a network to autom certain thing an upgrad servic for exampl if a certain modul has been updat it could be instal automat your websit will be easili upgrad there is a secur updat do you want it yes or no
wn some fear that if you focus on wealthi enterpris ngos might be disadvantag
db i have two answer to that answer one were just ad extra valu it not clear that were go after the big one were still determin our target audienc but were make contribut the other will not be wors off theyll remain status quo my second answer is a person vision i want to make it easi for peopl i want to empow them to use drupal i want to make web publish democrat this is a strong tendenc toward a social goal peopl often say that well focus more on the bigger one but i dont believ in that were not sure yet if well go after the big enterpris the ngos or the blogger weve just gather our capit and weve start hire peopl late ive spent about onethird of my time do interview and were still interview more peopl onethird of my time has gone to work with the drupal communiti releas patch and drupal _ and about onethird of my time has gone to product definit to determin what exact we will do with acquia
the futur near and far
wn speak about drupal _ you had a talk about it this morn im not go to ask you to repeat that present but what are the most import new element in drupal _
db the most import new featur are actual a good exampl of what were do for the common user drupal _ has becom a lot simpler to use weve made a lot of usabl improv but also for enterpris weve implement a better cach strategi a better loginfrastructur etc these are just some of the featur there are probabl __ to __ is also integr in drupal _
wn as a final question where will drupal be ten year from now and where will dri be ten year from now in boston
