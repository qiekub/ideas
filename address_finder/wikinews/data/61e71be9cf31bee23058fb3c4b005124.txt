tuesday march __ ____ this ice concentr map date march _ ____ indic maximum ice extent in the northern hemispher and the contour of the ice edg in ____ when the maximum extent was least extens dure the satellit era is shown in red while that for the __year averag is shown in gold has state that recent satellit imag have shown that despit an unusu cold winter in the the old or perenni ice on both the south/ENTITY pole/ENTITY has continu to melt while the level of new ice has increas as compar to last march
on march __ the scientist said they believ that the increas area of sea ice this winter is due to recent weather condit while the declin in perenni ice reflect the longerterm warm climat trend and is a result of increas melt dure summer and greater movement of the older ice out of the arctic
accord to nasaprocess microwav data wherea perenni ice use to cover ____ percent of the arctic this year it cover less than __ percent veri old ice that remain in the arctic for at least six year compris over __ percent of the arctic area in the mid to late ____s but this winter it decreas to just six percent
although this march the area is slight larger than last march the area of thick perenni ice has reach an all time low so the volum of arctic ice continu to decreas said nasa cryospher scienc program manag seely martin
arctic sea ice grow and declin season rang from an averag minimum extent in septemb of __ million squar mile __ million squear km to an averag winter maximum extent of __ million squar mile ___ million squar km in march this march instrument on nasa aqua/ENTITY satellit/ENTITY nation/ENTITY ocean/ENTITY and/ENTITY atmospher/ENTITY administr/ENTITY noaa and the unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY defens/ENTITY depart/ENTITY satellit show the maximum sea ice extent slight increas by __ percent over that of the previous three year but it is still below the longterm averag by __ percent increas in ice extent occur in area where surfac temperatur were colder than the histor averag at the same time as a result of the export of ice from the arctic the area of perenni ice decreas to an alltim minimum
joey comiso of nasa goddard space flight center in greenbelt md the lead author of a ____ relat studi use data from nasa passiv microwav data set to establish that the perenni ice cover at the summer arctic ice minimum in ____ was about __ percent less than the __year averag accord to the latest observ from the nation snow and ice data center an organ partial fund by nasa perenni sea ice drop from about __ percent of the total ice pack last year to __ percent of total ice this winter the perenni ice is also grow younger mean that it is thinner and will be more vulner dure the summer melt period
accord to walt meier of the nation/ENTITY snow/ENTITY and/ENTITY ice/ENTITY data/ENTITY center/ENTITY at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY colorado/ENTITY boulder/ENTITY as ice age it continu to grow and thicken so that older ice is general also thicker ice this winter the ice cover is much thinner overal and thus in a more vulner state head into the summer melt season
it becom thinner and thinner and much more suscept to melt dure the summer much more like to melt away it may look ok on the surfac but it like look at a hollywood movi set you see the facad of a build and it look ok but if you look behind it there no build there said meier satellit has contribut to understand of the chang in ice thick to get a better understand of the behavior of sea ice nasa is plan a followon satellit mission icesat ii to launch in ____
