peter whyatt of the neighbourhood associ is joint lead the project to restor the mural yesterday he told he had a number of concern about the possibl success of the project
there are a great number of problem with get this project off the ground and we also need to act pretti quick for a number of reason said mr whyatt
first the mural is in a terribl state and deterior quick there is more graffiti be daub on the site everi month becaus one bit of graffiti attract anoth bit we realli need to start the work in the next __ month becaus go through anoth winter with the condit of the wall will caus more problem and inevit more expens we want to keep as much origin artwork on the site as possibl to keep the cost down this is a big mural and it will be expens to restor he continu
and that bring me to my second concern cost if we dont get other communiti organis on board to bid for money for this with us and to involv their beneficiari and volunt it will be veri difficult to secur the money need money is veri tight at the moment becaus to the current financi climat we need to get support at this meet on tuesday and some firm commit from peopl and organis to get involv
last there is a danger of a commerci develop on the site a publicpriv partnership to creat a new art featur becaus of the exist mural subject matter it mock properti specul and land develop etc a commerci scheme probabl back by a properti develop would not want to restor the mural origin messag theyd want some good news scheme some greenwash idea that paint them in a posit light
howev despit these problem camden council have offer to do a condit survey on the mural this will save us a lot of money but have said that there are five council depart to deal with to get permiss for this restor work and they dont alway talk to each other
but if the public and local voluntari organis show their support we can make it happen mr whyatt conclud
the mural restor will be just one part of a year long project of heritag and conserv awarenessrais the project is not just about the mural but also wider plan to promot awar of heritag and conserv in an area of london under threat from commerci develop in fact the bulk of the project is about the heritag and conserv and the mural is just one part of it and the most visibl becaus of it situat mr whyatt later ad
