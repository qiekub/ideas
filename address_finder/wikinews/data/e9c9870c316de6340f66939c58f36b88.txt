i can talk to both side of the isl i have friend on both side and can intermedi veri well between the two parti the two side are often recommend much the same thing but with differ word i can translat if you read my bloomberg column about health care reform and tax reform youll see this abil to connect the dot for both side plus if i were elect it would be on the basi of my propos polici not my great look or person the politician would be on clear notic with respect to what polici the public want implement if they didnt implement them theyd have me campaign against them regardless of which parti they were in
