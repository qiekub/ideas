tuesday januari __ ____
in late ____ a expedit to drill through the ross/ENTITY ice/ENTITY shelf/ENTITY so they could send an under it what they found was unexpect sea/ENTITY anemon/ENTITY in their thousand they were do what no other speci of sea anemon is known to do they were live in the ice itself discov by the antarct drill project the team was so unprepar for discoveri they did not have suitabl preserv and the onli chemic avail obliter the creatur nonetheless marymegan dali of ohio/ENTITY state/ENTITY univers/ENTITY confirm the anim were a new/ENTITY speci/ENTITY edwardsiella/ENTITY andrilla/ENTITY after the drill project that found it the anemon was final describ in a plos/ENTITY one/ENTITY paper last month
andril lower their cylindr camera rov down a freshlybor ___ hole enabl it to reach seawat below the ice the devic was mere be test ahead of it plan mission retriev data on ocean current and the subic environ instead it found what andril director frank rack of the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY nebraskalincoln/ENTITY a coauthor of the paper describ the find call the total serendip of a whole new ecosystem that no one had ever seen befor
the discoveri rais mani question burrow sea anemon worm their way into substrat or use their tentacl to dig but it unclear how e andrilla enter the hard ice with onli their tentacl protrud into the water from the underneath of the ice shelf question also revolv around how the anim avoid freez how they reproduc and how they cope with the continu melt natur of their home their diet is also a mysteri what fascin me about sea anemon is that theyr abl to do thing that seem imposs marymegan dali
e andrilla is an opaqu white with an inner ring of eight tentacl and twelvetosixteen tentacl in an outer ring the rov light produc an orang glow from the creatur although this may be produc by their food it measur ____mm ____in but when fulli relax can extend to tripl that
genet analysi be imposs dali turn to dissect of the specimen but could find noth out of the ordinari scientist hope to send a biolog mission to explor the area under the massiv ice sheet which is in excess of ___ mile ___km wide the camera also observ worm fish that swim invert as if the ici roof was the sea floor and a cylindr creatur that use appendag on it end to move and to grab hold of the anemon is provid fund to aid further research owe to possibl similar between this ici realm and a moon of biolog research is plan for ____ an applic for fund to the us/ENTITY nation/ENTITY scienc/ENTITY foundat/ENTITY which fund andril is also pend
the andril team almost fail to get ani sampl at all design to examin the seafloor the rov had to be invert to examin the roof of ice weather condit prevent biolog sampl equip be deliv from mcmurdo/ENTITY station/ENTITY but the scientist retriev ____ anemon by use hot water to stun them befor suck them from their burrow with an improvis devic fashion from a coffe filter and a spare rov thruster preserv onsit in ethanol they were taken to mcmurdo station where some were further preserv with this map show the locat of the ross ice shelf in the antarct and the two known local for e andrilla relat to mcmurdo station
wikinew how did you come to be involv with this discoveri
marymegan dali frank rack got in touch after they return from antarctica in hope that i could help with an identif on the anemon
wikinew what was your first reaction upon learn there was an undiscov ecosystem under the ice in the ross sea
md i was amaz and realli excit i think to say it was unexpect is inaccur becaus it impli that there was a wellfound expect of someth the technolog that frank and his colleagu are use to explor the ice is so import becaus given our lack of data we have no reason expect of what it should be like or what it shouldnt be like
wikinew there a return trip plan hope for ____ with both biologist and andril geologist are you intend to go there yourself
md i would love to but i am also happi to not go as long as someon collect more anim on my behalf what i want to do with the anim requir new materi preserv in divers way but it doesnt requir me to be there although i am sure that be there would enhanc my understand of the anim and the system in which they live and would help me formul more and better question about the anemon ship time is expens especi in antarctica and if there are biologist whose contribut is predic on be there they should have prioriti to be there
wikinew these anim are shroud in mysteri some of the most intrigu question are chemic do they produc some kind of and is that orang glow in the rov light their own talk us through the difficulti encount when tri to find answer with the specimen on hand
md the sampl we have are small in term of number and they are all preserv in a kind of formaldehyd solut the formalin is great for preserv structur but for anemon it prevent studi of dna or of the chemistri of the bodi this mean we cant look at the issu you rais with these anim what we could do howev was to studi anatomi and figur out what it is so that when we have sampl preserv for studi eg the or conduct test of the fluid in the burrow or in the anim themselv we can make precis comparison and figur out what these anim have or do metabol or chemic that let them live where they live dali explain how she obtain these imag of the anemon anatomi
just know a whole lot about a singl speci isnt veri use even if that anim is as special as these clear are we need to know what about them is differ and thus relat to live in this strang way the onli way to get at what differ is to make comparison with close relat we can start that side of the work now anticip have more beast in the futur
in term of their glow i suspect that it not their although luminesc is common in anemon relat they dont usual make light themselv they do make a host of floresc protein and these may interact with the light of the rov to give that gorgeous glow
wikinew what analysi did you perform on the specimen and what equip was use
md i use a dissect scope to look at the anim extern anatomi and overal bodi organ magnif of __x i embed a few of the anim in wax and then cut them into veri thin slice use a mount the slice on microscop slide stain the slice to enhanc contrast and then look at those slide under a compound/ENTITY microscop/ENTITY that how i got the pictur of the muscl etc in the paper i use that same compound scope to look at squash bit of tissu to see the sting capsul i compar the thing i saw under the scope to what had been publish on other speci in this group this step seem trivial but it is realli the most import part by compar my observ to what my colleagu and predecessor had found i figur out what group it belong to and was abl to determin that within that group it was a new speci
wikinew it was three year between recoveri of specimen and final public whi did it take so long
md you mean how did we manag to make it all happen so quick right it was about two year from when frank sent me specimen to when we got the paper out some of that time was just lost time i had other project in the queue that i need to finish onc we figur out what it was we play a lot of manuscript email tag which can be challeng and time consum given the differ schedul that folk keep in term of travel field work etc manuscript review and process took about four month
wikinew what sort of difficulti were pose by the unorthodox preserv use and what addit work might be possibl on a specimen with intact dna
md the preserv was not unorthodox they follow best practic for anatom preserv have dnasuit materi will let us see whether there are new gene or gene turn on in differ way and at differ time that help explain how these anim burrow into hard ice and then surviv in the cold i am curious about the popul structur of the field of anemon the group to which edwardsiella andrilla belong includ mani speci that reproduc asexu and it possibl that the field are clone produc asexu rather than the result of sexual reproduct dna is the onli way to test this
wikinew do you have ani theori about the strategi employ to cope with the harsh environ of burrow insid an ice shelf
md i think there must be some kind of antifreez produc the cell in contact with ice would otherwis freez
wikinew how has such an appar larg popul of clear unusu sea anemon not to mention the other creatur caught on camera gone undetect for so long
md i think this reflect how difficult it is to get under the ice and to collect specimen that be said sinc the paper came out i have been point toward two other report that are probabl record of these speci one from scientist who look at footag from camera attach to seal and one from who dove under ice in both of these case the anemon if that what they saw was seen at a distanc and no specimen were collect without the anim in hand or the capabl of a rov to get close up for pictur it is hard to know what has been seen and lack a definit id hard to have the find appropri index or contextu
wikinew would it be fair to say this suggest there may be other undiscov speci of sea anemon that burrow into hard substrat such as ice
md i hope so what fascin me about sea anemon is that theyr abl to do thing that seem imposs given their seem limit toolkit this find certain expand the realm of possibl
