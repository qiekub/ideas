the world organ for anim health oie and the food and agricultur organ both part of the unit/ENTITY nation/ENTITY have state that some countri particular and some countri in are underreport the number of human case of the dead avian/ENTITY flu/ENTITY bird flu virus but also said that the countri are not hide them deliber
we know that some countri might be underreport most do not do it deliber we are concern about china and indonesia and africa becaus the virus seem to be so widespread that we could not get all the inform it is difficult to know about each individu outbreak in a back yard said doctor christiann bruschk in rome/ENTITY itali/ENTITY on wednesday and who is head of the oie bird flu taskforc
bruschk also said that farmer lack the educ they need on the virus and need to be reimburs financi for ani educ they need cite that the richer nation should help fund the educ they need and that lack of veterinari clinic distanc to them and time are also to blame for the underreport
in africa farmer will probabl not report sick anim said bruschk
their veterinari servic are veri weak and mani countri do not have laboratori facil we have all the ingredi there that could lead to underreport she ad
bruschk also said that indonesia may not be report all human or anim case also state that the virus is perman infect poultri in the countri which make it increas difficult for anyon to report outbreak
i think it could be the case becaus in certain region the virus is get more or less endem so in region like java they might not report everi singl outbreak anymor said bruschk
accord to bruschk china is cooper but she also said that china is a veri big countri and that there are case of infect in wild bird
we sometim see the outbreak in wild anim they will not alway detect them there is also not a veri good compens scheme in place so we feel there might be underreport said bruschk
