sunday may _ ____ rover engin check how a test rover move in materi chosen to simul some difficult mar drive condit credit nasajpl
mar rover engin have built a test bed simul the condit of the mar rover opportun which becam stuck in a martian sand dune on april __ the test bed use a combin of materi includ play sand for children sandbox diatomac earth for swim pool filter and mortar clay powder
opportun dug into soft sand to wheelhub depth as it drove over a dune about onethird meter one foot tall and __ meter _ feet wide weve climb over dozen of rippl but this one is differ in that it seem to be a littl taller and to have a steeper slope about __ degre on part of it face said mark maimon a jet/ENTITY propuls/ENTITY laboratori/ENTITY jpl rover mobil engin test will be conduct use an earthbound twin of the rover and the simul martian dune to determin how to best maneuv opportun out of the predica befor transmit command to the actual vehicl
we choos to proceed cautious so we dont expect to begin actual drive out of the dune befor next week possibl later said jim erickson rover project manag at jpl both opportun and spirit have alreadi provid mani more month of scientif explor than anyon expect by take good care of them we hope to keep them explor for more month to come test so far have sustain our optim about opportun abil to drive out of this dune but we have more test ahead to understand how robust that capabl is
engin construct a simul dune last week use sand that was alreadi at jpls rover test facil and put a test rover into a similar dugin posit the test rover had no difficulti drive away even when sunk bellydeep howev that sand offer better traction than the finer looser materi that appear to make up the surfac at opportun current posit we need to do test use materi more like what opportun is in someth that has a fluffier textur and cake onto the wheel said jpl rover engin rick welch who is lead the test
base on imag of wheel and wheel track from mar dr robert sullivan of cornel univers a rover scienc team member work with engin in the jpl test bed help match the properti of the test sand as close as possibl with those of the sand beneath opportun we found that when the wheel dig in the materi were use doe stick to the wheel and fill the gap between the cleat but it doesnt stick when your just drive over it that good becaus it the same as what we see in the imag from opportun sullivan said experi show that the test rover after some initi wheelspin can drive out of the more powderi materi
the team went to sever home suppli and hardwar store to find enough bag and box of the ingredi to make more than _ ton of the simul mar sand for the more realist mobil test accord to jpl rover mobil engin jeff biesiadeckia mar explor rover opportun get stuck in a small sand dune may _ ____
