although investig are ongo the unit/ENTITY kingdom/ENTITY air/ENTITY accid/ENTITY investig/ENTITY branch/ENTITY aaib has issu interim report indic ice buildup on an engin compon as the jet pass over on it journey from it encount signific reduc temperatur the aaib has determin that the fuel was at a temperatur below _c for an unusu long durat this is believ to have caus water in the fuel which met all relev intern standard to have frozen into crystal
a buildup of ice develop on a compon call the fueloil heat exchang this restrict the flow of fuel to the engin result in an uncommand engin rollback a loss of power on approach for land investig initi struggl to produc enough ice under test condit but later discov that at high concentr fuel can form ice at veri low temperatur in enough quantiti to serious restrict fuel flow this doe not occur when fuel demand is lower as the hot oil then becom suffici to entir melt the ice it was onli when extra fuel was pump in from the tank for the land that the crystal becam a problem the fueloil heat exchang is a dual purpos part design to simultan melt fuel ice and cool down engin oil by pass oil pipe through the fuel flow if i am correct that it is a product liabil suit then the fact that this is the first such accid matter not scot lawyer peter macdonald
the crew of the aircraft were prais for their handl of the emerg avoid the airport perimet fenc and nearbi hous to crash land short of the runway none of the ___ passeng and __ crew were kill but some of those suffer serious injuri includ broken bone and facial injuri some were left unabl to fli and there were case of post/ENTITY traumat/ENTITY stress/ENTITY disord/ENTITY the crash was trigger by high unusu circumst the first aaib report note that cold fuel behav in this manner was an appar hitherto unknown phenomenon as part of the investig data of ______ flight of ___s equip with the engin model involv the rollsroyc/ENTITY trent/ENTITY ___/ENTITY was review without find ani relev circumst similar to the accid flight although there was later a similar incid in the unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY in which the aircraft continu safe after repow one engin the second did not lose power
given the circumst surround the case wikinew ask peter macdonald if the intend to prove that boe knew or should have known the powerpl was danger defect by design i rather suspect that there may be product liabil legisl in place in whichev us jurisdict is be use macdonald explain such statut normal do not requir proof of fault nor do they requir proof of knowledg all that you have to show is that there was a defect in the product which caus the loss concern if i am correct that it is a product liabil suit then the fact that this is the first such accid matter not rollsroyc would be liabl for a defect in term of the consum protect act ____ peter macdonald
macdonald went on to discuss the intern legisl and how it interact to the plaintiff and the three compani involv boe british/ENTITY airway/ENTITY onli boe is current name in an action over the case there are sever reason whi the plaintiff will wish to sue boe in the state he said were the plaintiff to seek redress in a court in the unit kingdom it is unlik that the relev part of boe would be subject to jurisdict here he also point out that us damag are general higher than english damag
as to whether boe should settl that all depend upon the basi of the action if it is a fault neglig base action they will be abl to defend it if fault is not need that is whi they would want the action dismiss forc litig in the uk in the uk a product liabil suit would ordinarili be direct against the import ie british airway it would be a simpl matter to sue ba here the uk for the physic injuri and their financi consequ said macdonald that leav rr rollsroyc i assum that the engin was made in the uk they would be liabl for a defect in term of the consum protect act ____ part i this piec of ukwid legisl state that where ani damag is caus wholli or part by a defect in a product the manufactur shall be liabl for the damag damag includ injuri this pictur from the investig demonstr the effect of ice buildup on the part in question
us court decid intern jurisdict issu under the jone/ENTITY act/ENTITY pass as a result of bhopal/ENTITY litig/ENTITY which make it much more difficult for a foreign to sue in the us if the accid did not happen there my restrict understand of that is that it is like that it would be difficult to remov an action from a us court where the aircraft was made in the us he further point out that the court would requir there to be an altern court with jurisdict over the issu it may well be that the relev part of the boe group is not subject to the jurisdict of the english court i have seen case where it was made a condit of the grant of an order under the jone act that the defend would submit to the jurisdict of a court in scotland and that they would not take a plea of time/ENTITY bar/ENTITY in the even that an action was rais within three month of the court order
he then address the intern law with regard to what could be claim for against air carrier such as ba in a previous case against the same airlin abnett v british airway the hous/ENTITY of/ENTITY lord/ENTITY rule in ____ that the onli remedi for an injur passeng on an intern flight is to sue under the warsaw/ENTITY convent/ENTITY articl __ incorpor into our law by the carriag by air act ____ the warsaw convent govern liabil for intern commerci airlin at the time the hous of lord was the highest court of appeal in the uk although it was recent replac by the suprem court the abnett case refer to british/ENTITY airway/ENTITY flight/ENTITY ___/ENTITY in which captur the aircraft and occup when it land in hour after iraq invad in ____ peter macdonald repres abnett in this case
the convent provid a remedi for bodili injuri interest the term onli appear in the final draft of the warsaw convent there is no mention of the term in the minut of the mani session which lead up to the final draft it was produc overnight and sign later that day this term creat difficulti in claim for mental problem such as the fear of fli or ptsd although macdonald point out that there is a larg amount of medic literatur which detail physic and chemic chang in the brain of peopl who are suffer from ptsd
in king v bristow helicopt heard befor the hous of lord in ____ held that ptsd was not a bodili injuri but expressli left the door open for someon to tri to prove that what is known as ptsd is the manifest of physic chang in the brain which have been brought about by the trauma such a litig is pend in scotland macdonald is act in this case
action against boe are not bound in this way as the warsaw convent onli appli to airlin make the state an attract place to sue due to the issu with demonstr jurisdict against the relev part of the boe group in the uk anoth reason whi the plaintiff would prefer to sue in america is that in the uk there would be liabil for ba and that would be subject to a damag cap an action in the us against ani defend would probabl have the same cap but is like to award damag more generous in the event that the cap is not reach victim of london jetlin crash sue boe novemb __ ____ us uk investig seek ___ engin redesign to stop repeat of london jet crash march __ ____ interim report blame ice for british airway ___ crash in london septemb _ ____ consum protect act ____
