on tuesday astronom of the carnegi/ENTITY institut/ENTITY for/ENTITY scienc/ENTITY washington/ENTITY dc/ENTITY unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY announc the discoveri of ten small satellit orbit jupit with this discoveri now has __ known satellit
the team led by scott/ENTITY sheppard/ENTITY had discov twelv of the __ jovian satellit includ tuesday ten most use a blanco _meter telescop of cerro/ENTITY tololo/ENTITY interamerican/ENTITY observatori/ENTITY the observatori is oper by the nation/ENTITY optic/ENTITY astronomi/ENTITY observatori/ENTITY in the us the tini satellit none more than five kilometr in diamet were first observ in ____ orbit of these new jovian satellit were calcul by intern/ENTITY astronom/ENTITY union/ENTITY minor/ENTITY planet/ENTITY center/ENTITY gareth/ENTITY william/ENTITY william explain it take sever observ to confirm an object actual orbit around jupit so the whole process took a year
the astronom were look for planet much farther out than sheppard said jupit just happen to be in the sky near the search field where we were look for extrem distant solar/ENTITY system/ENTITY object so we were abl to look for new moon around jupit while at the same time look for planet at the fring of our solar system
of the twelv satellit discov by the team nine were found to be revolv around the gas giant in the direct opposit to the planet spin these nine new retrograd satellit take about two year to complet one revolut around jupit
the remain three satellit were prograd spin in the same direct as jupit rotat one of the prograd satellit newli announc on tuesday took about oneandhalf year to complet one revolut around jupit and it orbit intersect with the outer retrograd satellit sheppard said our other discoveri is a real oddbal and has an orbit like no other known jovian moon it also like jupit smallest known moon be less than one kilometr in diamet the astronom also said this is an unstabl situat headon collis would quick break apart and grind the object down to dust
sheppard said of the composit of those satellit they start orbit jupit instead of fall into it so we think they are intermedi between rocki asteroid and ici comet so they are probabl half ice and half rock is the name suggest for the oddbal satellit was the s greatgranddaught regard as the goddess of health and hygien
sheppard said jupit is like a big vacuum cleaner becaus it is so massiv jupit is the largest planet in the solar system with a diamet about ______ kilometr the largest known satellit in the solar system is jupit whose diamet is approxim ____ kilometr has the secondmost known satellit __ while has __
