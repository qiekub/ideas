the object is inclin by a whop __ degre to the main plane of the solar system where most of the other planet orbit that whi it elud discoveri nobodi was look there until now brown said
most object in the solar system are just a few degre from the main plane of the solar system call the pluto which is consid substanti differ from the rest of the planet is onli __ degre from this main plane astronom who studi the sky for asteroid and comet usual look in the region of the sky that the rest of the planet occupi
the bright of this object is just bare fainter than the telescop from earlier sky survey were abl to identifi so new advanc in the make of telescop has also play a part in this discoveri

defin planet these timelaps imag of a newfound planet in our solar system call ____ ub___ were taken on oct __ ____ use the samuel oschin telescop at the palomar observatori near san diego calif the planet circl in white is seen move across a field of star the three imag were taken about __ minut apart scientist did not discov that the object in these pictur was a planet until jan _ ____ sourc samuel oschin telescop palomar observatori
there has been controversi in the scientif communiti about what is and what is not a planet some purist insist the solar system has onli eight planet and that kuiper belt object includ pluto sedna and ____ ub___ cannot be list among the major planet
a minor furor erupt when the iau suggest remov pluto from the pantheon of planet a few year ago becaus of that pluto status as a planet in addit to be a kuiper belt object was cement but with the discoveri of ____ ub___ the planet or not debat may rekindl
pluto has been a planet for so long that the world is comfort with that brown said in the teleconfer it seem to me a logic extens that anyth bigger than pluto and farther out is a planet

this object is in a class veri much like pluto he said
a second object found
the new __th planet was not the onli new discoveri in the kuiper belt this past week jos√©lui/ENTITY ortiz/ENTITY at the sierra/ENTITY nevada/ENTITY observatori/ENTITY announc the discoveri of an object call ____/ENTITY el__/ENTITY this object thought to be larger than sedna is the brightest transneptun object next to pluto
although some news media confus the discoveri of ____ el__ with ____ ub___ they are differ object
____ el__ is so bright it can be seen with highend amateurgrad telescop equip with ccd/ENTITY camera/ENTITY although this second discoveri may not be as larg as ____ ub___ scientist have confirm that ____ el__ has it own moon
