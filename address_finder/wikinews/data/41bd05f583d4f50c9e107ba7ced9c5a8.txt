wn would you call this event a success
aparna garg yeah so far yes
wn what are the challeng face by women work for indian railway
aparna garg challeng i would say are the same as you find in the societi for a women to achiev someth is not as easi as it is for a man they have to put doubl the effort and the recognit come veri late and then women are multitask everywher so a ladi who come to work in the offic first see her hous and then she come to work and then again she goe back and she doe household work so she is much more pressur and i find them veri sincer despit all the pressur i find them extrem sincer and dedic
wn what are the possibl remedi to these issu
aparna garg issu are basic celebr of women day and all these event they do bring women in focus but what is requir at larg is a chang in the societi and the mindset which should begin in each hous and if we have boy in the hous and we have male colleagu we have to sensatis them more and so that onc we have the support of these peopl and their mindset chang and that is how we can influenc the collect conscious
wn what is the genderdistribut ratio at the mysor divis branch
aparna garg mysor divis we have ten percent onli women employe out of a total of say ____ employe we have around ___ so that is around ten percent
wn are you happi with this number
aparna garg yeah it is okay see the idea is each accord to their choic the peopl who have chosen to work here have gotten i person dont believ in this too much of genderbia they are all individu
wn has this number been improv in the past year
more number of women get into technic field has been a big chang aparna garg mysor division railway manag
aparna garg it has improv it has improv it was around seven or eight percent over the two year it has increas more number of women get into technic field has been a big chang earlier it wasnt come you would find in offic staff okay which is a ministeri cadr but now get women employe in loco pilot categori in station master as guard as pointswoman they are all work on track as carriag and wagon helper so yes there has been a chang
women loco pilot are come in a big wave and it is not a veri difficult job the duti hour is eighthour so onc they cover eight hour they chang so it is not that in some remot area they have to drive no eight hour their shift chang so if a loco pilot start from here mayb at or some place they will chang so we have someth call run room where the have all the facil so they deboard there and after take due rest they take a train back to their home place so yes ladi are come in a big wave
wn what are the step indian railway is take for improv this number
an there is not genderbas reserv pers from what i know but indian railway has been veri open about it now you see drms i am sit here there was a time when the number of ladi whod becom drm was veri less so now we have around __ divis mayb eight are women so the number everywher it is go up it has been veri posit about it wn can you brief me your role as mysor division railway manag
