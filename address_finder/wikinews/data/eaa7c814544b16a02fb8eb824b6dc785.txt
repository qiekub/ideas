in find publish friday in a multin team of scientist led by antoin strugarek of the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY montreal/ENTITY announc the sun may not be the cosmic oddbal amongst solartyp/ENTITY star/ENTITY some astronom had believ it to be they found that although the sun cycl appear to differ from those of other star of it type they are govern by the same law work in the same way view of a sunspot from file
the sun has long been known to go through elevenyear/ENTITY cycl/ENTITY of high and low activ includ which strugarek liken to solar volcano time of high activ are also the most like time for coron/ENTITY mass/ENTITY eject/ENTITY which often eman from sunspot region on rare occas these erupt of plasma may hit the earth magnet field set it oscil it then releas previous trap particl as the aurora/ENTITY boreali/ENTITY and/ENTITY australi/ENTITY occasion the effect are so intens that these charg particl and magnet effect can ding the perform of satellit and power grid the pole flip at the time of high activ and the intens of the magnet field peak when the sun is least activ a hypothet heatproof compass on the surfac of the sun would point toward one pole dure one elevenyear period but toward the other dure the next
to predict and explain this activ strugarek and colleagu develop a model of the highenergi matter insid the sun and examin how it flow and chang could creat magnet field to build this model they incorpor data from __ differ star
they found the sun oper on the same basic principl as other star the activ of all star in the system was found to be driven by their luminos their rotat and noth els the luminos and rotat are use togeth to determin a star rossbi/ENTITY number/ENTITY which is relat to plasma flow the smaller the rossbi number the less activ the star with respect to magnet revers
