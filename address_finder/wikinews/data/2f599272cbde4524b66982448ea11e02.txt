a recent studi by the unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY geolog/ENTITY survey/ENTITY usg show that the oil and gas industri are creat new inform from the region of the unit state point out that these manmad earthquak are happen more frequent than expect while more frequent earthquak are less of a problem for region like the midwest a geolog professor from the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY southern/ENTITY indiana/ENTITY dr paul k doss believ the dispos of wastewat from the hydraul/ENTITY fractur/ENTITY or frack process use in extract oil and gas has the possibl to pose potenti problem for groundwat map show signific earthquak in the midwest region of the unit state it was analyz to show link between felt earthquak and energi develop
we are take this fluid that has a whole host of chemic in it that are use for frack and put it back into the earth doss said from a pure seismic perspect these are not big earthquak that are go to caus damag or initi as far as we know ani larger kind of earthquak activ for midwest the issu is a water qualiti issu in term of the ground water resourc that we use hydraul/ENTITY fractur/ENTITY or frack is a techniqu use by the oil and gas industri which inject high pressur water down into the earth/ENTITY crust/ENTITY to break rock and extract natur gas most of the fluid use for frack are proprietari so inform about what chemic are use in the various fluid are unknown to the public and to creat a competit edg
last monday four research from the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY new/ENTITY brunswick/ENTITY releas an editori that shed light on the potenti risk that the current wastewat dispos system could have on the provinc water resourc the research share the concern that dr doss has and have come out to say that they believ frack should be stop in the provinc until there is an environment safe way to dispos the wast wastewat
if groundwat becom contamin it take year to decad to tri to clean up an aquif system univers of new brunswick professor tom al said
while the usg group which conduct the studi say it is unclear how the earthquak rate may be relat to oil and gas product theyv made the correl between the dispos of wastewat use in frack and the recent upsurg in earthquak becaus of the recent inform surfac that show this connect between the dispos process and earthquak individu state in the unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY are now pass law regard dispos well the problem is that we have never as a human societi engin a hole to go four mile down in the earth crust that we have complet confid that it wont leak dr paul k doss
the problem is that we have never as a human societi engin a hole to go four mile down in the earth crust that we have complet confid that it wont leak doss said a perfect caseinpoint is the gulf/ENTITY of/ENTITY mexico/ENTITY oil spill in ____ that oil was be drill at _____ feet but leak at the surfac and that the concern becaus there no assur that some of these unknown chemic cocktail wont escap befor it get down to where they are tri to get rid of them
it was said in the studi releas by the new brunswick univers professor that if frack wastewat would contamin groundwat that current convent water treatment would not be suffici enough to remov the high concentr of chemic use in frack the research did find that the wastewat could be recycl can also be dispos of at proper site or even pump further underground into salin aquif
the new brunswick professor have come to the conclus that current frack method use by compani which use the water should be replac with carbon dioxid or liquefi propan gas
you elimin all the waterrel issu that were rais and that peopl have rais in general across north america al said new/ENTITY brunswick/ENTITY liquefi propan gas has been use success in frack some well but accord to water specialist with the provinc natur resourc depart anni daigl it may not be the goto solut for new brunswick due it geolog makeup
it has been use success by corridor resourc here in new brunswick for lower volum hydraul fractur oper but it is still a fair new technolog daigl said unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY environment/ENTITY protect/ENTITY agenc/ENTITY epa is work with us state to come up with guidelin to manag seismic risk due to wastewat under the safe drink water act the epa is the organ that also deal with the polici for well oil field locat in lost hill in california
oil well which are under regul pump out salt water known as and after brine is pump out of the ground it dispos of by be pump back into the ground the differ between pump brine and the high pressur frack fluid back in the ground is the volum that it is dispos of
brine has never caus this kind of earthquak activ doss said the whole oil and gas industri has develop around the remov of natur gas by frack techniqu and has outpac regulatori develop the regul is tie to the the runofthemil dispos of wast in other word the rush to produc this gas has occur befor regulatori agenc have had the opportun to respond
accord to the usg studi the increas in inject wastewat into the ground may explain the sixfold increas of earthquak in the central part of the unit state from ____ ____ usg research also found that in decad prior to ____ seismic event that happen in the midsect of the us averag __ annual in ____ it spike to __ and in ____ seismic event hit ___
the incred volum and intens dispos of frack fluid in concentr area is what new doss said there is not a bodi of regul in place to manag the how these fluid are dispos of
the studi by the usg was present at the annual meet of the seismolog societi of america on april __ ____
