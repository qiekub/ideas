wednesday june __ ____ phoenix took this imag on sol __ june _ ____ it show two trench dug by phoenix robot arm the left trench was the first test trench phoenix/ENTITY lander/ENTITY has begun to cook a scoop full of soil for reason unknown to scientist and after sever seem unsuccess attempt to break up the soil a larg amount was discov to have pass through a screen lead to an on board oven
we have an oven full it took __ second to fill the oven the ground move said phoenix coinvestig bill boynton a research at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY arizona/ENTITY locat in the lander robot arm deliv a partial scoop of clumpi soil from a trench inform call babi bear to the number _ oven on it thermal and evolv gas analyz last friday june _ nasa observ the method and report that no soil had pass through the screen over the tega the screen is to prevent larger bit of soil from clog the narrow port to each oven so that fine particl fill the oven caviti which is no wider than a pencil lead the oven goal is to vapor ani ice or water that may be present in the soil miner may also burn off and scientist say that vapor from anyth that evapor or vapor will be test and analyz
after some debat nasa decid to shake the soil in hope that it would break up the larger particl to much disappoint after six tri use this method onli a few particl got through the screen scientist then order one last shake of the soil in the off chanc we might get lucki state boynton
after a few day of troubleshoot nasa look back at the soil and discov that for an unknown reason a larg amount of soil had fallen through the screen and was readi for inspect by the tega boynton state that it is possibl that the oven might have fill becaus of the cumul effect of all the shake or becaus of chang in the soil cohes as it sat for day on the top of the screen
there someth veri unusu about this soil from a place on mar weve never been befor were interest in learn what sort of chemic and miner activ has caus the particl to clump and stick togeth boynton comment
phoenix was origin order to put off use it tega until scientist came up with a solut to the clod soil it had been reschedul to take read of the martian climat such as temperatur and wind speed and also to analyz a soil sampl use the optic microscop or meca microscopi electrochemistri and conduct analyz on june __ scientist say that those task are still schedul to take place pictur and result from that sampl are expect to arriv on thursday june __ while the oven sampl will take a few day to analyz
the dirt final did start to flow and we actual got a full oven so that problem is now behind us were hope that some time in the next few day well close the oven and begin the analysi process ad boynton
