ds what kind of crowd is there
an from what i could tell we play for a lot of guitar hero fan and peopl who heard about us through friend of friend or came across us on myspac that sort of thing but for the most part a lot of the kid we meet are anywher betweenwel i guess at a club like that they have to be over __ but usual they are just much younger kid who are video game fan who have heard about us through guitar hero ii
ds what that like to have a fan base that come from primarili video game have you notic a differ between be known as a local band play in your citi and be known through video game how would you compar the audienc
an it differ in our hometown it start off as just a big word of mouth thing we had twenti guy in the band so everybodi had friendsoffriend we start a groundswel that way but when we get out of town not in new york so much but when we go to and place like that they general tend to be much younger peopl it a realli big thrill for bryn and i in that we are meet kid who are just like us young video game fan aspir musician usual male who pick up guitar they come to us and say nobodi play guitar anymor like you guy do or my parent use to listen to music like that it just a big thrill for us to meet young kid like that who remind us of ourselv when we were kid
ds how doe it feel to be lookedup to by the kid by america futur
an laugh it terrifi laugh
ds do you see parent at the show
an oh yeah oh yeah parent with their kid
ds that must reduc the crotch grab
an laugh yeah a littl bit of macho postur i tell you man it a realli big thrill just to go out and play in town weve never been to kid come out and they know all the song weve had situat where weve play new york and girl are in the front row sing along to our guitar solo like wowwer on stage play and we can hear them sing back at us someth els bryn and i have notic is at larger festiv show when we get to the end of our show we play push push ladi lightn the kid would just light up and start air/ENTITY guitar/ENTITY but not actual play air guitar but play air guitar herolik they knew where all the note were
ds which is a lot differ for audienc of mani band
an absolut i cant imagin other band have the same experi becaus we come from such a uniqu perspect that a larg part of our music is driven by the instrument and that sort of thing
ds your fan are so engag with your music far more than most band have most band they have fan who feel their music speak to them but your fan can say i learn to play guitar on your shit and not on eleanor/ENTITY rigbi/ENTITY an it an honor it still unbeliev to me i had a messag from a friend of mine who was at guitar center and he heard one of the kid crank out one of our song when he was tri out the guitar to me it like we made it
ds at this point of your career your not play stadium but your also not play otto tiki loung on a tuesday night when you reflect upon it what do you think about
an in the past two year sinc bryn and i start this project weve both been play in band local in boston for year we had some mix success we play larg venu in and around boston we got to the point where we said fuck it we just want to have some fun and wed laugh a lot go over old ozzi/ENTITY osbourn/ENTITY stuff we listen to as kid just giggl about it bang camaro start that way someth for us to do and invit our friend to come sing on it now just two year later it amaz what happen when you stop tri it someth not contriv or born of ani desir to reach an audienc we just did it for fun and that spoke to peopl more than anyth els we work on
ds do you have other area of your life where youv been abl to appli that
an laugh you mean as an etho dont tri laugh you know not realli i have found the greatest success in the thing i have put most of my effort into this band has been a complet uniqu experi in that respect at least in term of tri to forg a career in music bryn and i had gotten to the point where we thought mayb this wasnt the way to go bryn was go to go back to his career as a video game programm and i was just go to find someth els to do so not realli i dont realli appli that in ani other portion of my life
ds what are some dream project youd like to work on
an as a musician obvious for me it would be to meet and work with some hero of mine sinc i was a kid like mutt lang he alway made my favorit record at the same time it has also been a dream of mine to meet peopl like mark/ENTITY linkous/ENTITY those guy made honest sort of rock n roll for lack of a better comparison the way peopl like john/ENTITY lennon/ENTITY bob/ENTITY dylan/ENTITY would to me those are the artist of my generat it would be my dream one just to meet those guy and two just to work with them on some level id also be lie to say that it would just be my dream to take this project with twenti of my best friend and take it as far as we can take it so far in my life it been the most reward thing
ds in the creativ process it so difficult to be origin today everyth has been done do you ever let that trip you up the simpson/ENTITY did/ENTITY it/ENTITY an no not realli i found i would end up fall into that cycl play in indi/ENTITY rock/ENTITY band just tri to come up with the next thing like they stop use guitar and thing like that tri to kick the ball forward a littl bit instead of kick it side to side with this band we dont get hung up on that we origin just start it as a celebr of the thing we love when we were kid were not out here tri to reinvent the wheel were fortun in that when we were put the project togeth we want that big vocal sound what set us apart was how we went about do that we just invit all of our friend becaus we didnt want to multi track everyth ourselv soon after we had to figur out how to pull it off live and peopl would approach and say we heard you have this crazi project with all these peopl the project grew into the live monster it is out of necess were not rich peopl we dont have refriger and the big tour bus speak of dream mayb one day well have a tour bus for now we travel in two veri smelli van
