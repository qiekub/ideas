a more effici way to produc useabl has been demonstr by research it use veri hightemperatur to separ hydrogen from water so that hydrogen may be use for electrolysi is one method by which laboratori and factori produc hydrogen an electr current is pass through water break it down into hydrogen and oxygen gas which are then collect abov the water reservoir
research in salt/ENTITY lake/ENTITY citi/ENTITY utah/ENTITY at ceramtech incorpor in collabor with worker at the idaho nation engin and environment laboratori report that when water is superh to ___ degre celsius far less electr is requir to produc the same volum of hydrogen the research envis that futur nuclear fission plant could be use both to heat the water as part of their cool system and generat the need electr
concern have been rais regard the safeti of such arrang howev jeremi desterhoft an independ consult on nuclear energi safeti warn the elev level of radiat requir to suffici lower the atom separ point is beyond the current capabl of ani recent cooler he doe not believ that econom viabl cool technolog will be avail for at least four to six more year
