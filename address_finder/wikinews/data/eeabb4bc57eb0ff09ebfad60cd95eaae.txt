thursday octob __ ____ file photograph of robert gate in ____ defens secretari robert/ENTITY gate/ENTITY flew to on wednesday to ask defens minist to help the unit state respond to the request for more resourc made by the us and nato command in afghanistan general stanley/ENTITY mcchrystal/ENTITY gate told report on his aircraft that he believ it make sens to have these talk now becaus he said the effort to stabil and develop afghanistan is a nato mission not just one for the us
this is an allianc issu and my view all along has been we ought to do this in a way that if general mcchrystal has an addit set of need it should not be look upon as exclus the respons of the unit state to respond the defens secretari remark
gate said that sinc the nato summit last spring he has seen more energi and more commit among nato nation to do what is necessari to succeed in afghanistan he describ current consult with nato alli as intens general mcchrystal say the alli effort could fail to prevent a milit takeov in afghanistan unless he is given more resourc in a secret request he is believ to be ask for _____ or more addit troop on top of _____ us and near _____ coalit troop alreadi there presid barack obama is expect to decid on ani addit us deploy soon
gate ad that he want his nato counterpart to consid what addit commit they can also make to help revers gain made by the taliban and similar group in recent year
my hope is that we can have a serious discuss about how thing have chang in afghanistan sinc last spring and a way forward in which the allianc can share these respons and work with the afghan govern to move the situat in a more posit direct he said
but the secretari note that all contribut to the afghanistan effort do not have to be militari he said he head for bratislava with a menu of option for alli to consid and that much of the capabl general mcchrystal want is not controversi such as civilian assist train and financ for develop project
speak earli on thursday dure a visit to south korea gate also welcom the decis to hold a runoff to decid the afghan presidenti elect say all nation involv have an interest in a smooth process to provid the win candid with as much legitimaci as possibl
i think virtual all of the nation that increas their troop presenc to provid secur for the elect in august have kept those forc there and so are in a posit to tri and along with their afghan armi and polic counterpart provid as good a secur as possibl for the runoff elect he said
gate howev note that will not end problem of corrupt and weak govern in afghanistan he said the intern communiti will still have much work to do with ani new govern in kabul to provid the kind of stabil secur and servic that will have a chanc of convinc the afghan peopl to support the govern rather than the milit of the taliban and alqaida
