wn what do you think the impact will be for the paralymp movement will be with the game be live in the unit state for first time
simon ličen the impact depend on a number of aspect one of them is the channel that as the broadcast right owner for the unit state will use to air the paralymp game on will they be shown nation or region on nbc or on ani of the compani multipl cabl network a second aspect is the part or hour of the day the paralymp will be shown rememb that there is a ninehour differ between sochi and new/ENTITY york/ENTITY and a __hour differ between sochi and the us west coast so daytim event will be shown live in the unit state in the middl of the night and even primetim event will be shown inde live in the morn us time so show the paralymp live on unit state televis might turn out to be less glamor than it appear a third import factor is the way the event will be mediat will nbc have it best sport broadcast follow the event after have work the winter olymp will they treat and announc the competit as they do all other for better and wors will they take it as an opportun to educ viewer about disabl and divers while show superb athlet perform without engag in a discours of piti all in all i think this is a terrif opportun to improv sport coverag in a multitud of aspect but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcast will meet these expect wn what role should the media be play in promot the paralymp game whi doe the us media provid so littl coverag of the paralymp compar to other sport
simon ličen i dont think the media should be promot ani sport event i think the role of the media is to inform about the event and to cover it fair it is not just the paralymp game or disabl sport in general that yield veri littl media coverag a recent studi has shown that women/ENTITY sport/ENTITY onli account for ____ of televis news media the situat improv consider dure the olymp/ENTITY game/ENTITY and primetim olymp coverag come close to equal coverag of both men and women sport outsid of that howev us media coverag is larg limit to the men four major leagu colleg footbal and colleg basketbal again the media decid which sport to cover base on their perceiv entertain valu and it potenti of generat sponsor revenu the paralymp game are complex to understand and it particip hard to identifi with becaus there are less instanc of domin perform and longstand rivalri which are concept that are understand even to the casual fan
wn what role doe the fact that the paralymp are about peopl with disabl compet at sport play in the american public recept of the paralymp
simon ličen i would specul that the american public is larg indiffer to the event as it is current repres in the media the major of peopl are oblivi of the paralymp game they might greet an american medal winner as this would reaffirm the success supremaci and tenac of an american repres in a global field in more general term howev the american public choos to larg overlook disabl sport as the averag ablebodi person like doe not want to be repres by and thus identifi with a disabl person
wn is the fact the us olymp committe is the nation paralymp committe a hinder or help in the develop of the paralymp movement in the us
simon ličen in general term this is both an opportun and a risk it can activ it sizabl financi promot and media influenc to bring attent to the paralymp movement but at the same time might choos to push disabl sport to the side in order to accommod influenti sponsor i am not familiar with the specif work done by the us olymp committe in term of support popular and expand the paralymp movement so i cannot specul which way the actual work done by the usoc sway
wn what condit need to exist in the us for paralymp athlet to get sponsorship similar to their olymp counterpart
simon ličen sport sponsorship are inde strong influenc by the media promin of compet individu individu disabl athlet have alreadi been abl to secur profit sponsorship and endors contract perhap the most notabl exampl is oscar/ENTITY pistorius/ENTITY who was in this sens a true groundbreak befor fall off the pedest due to his pend trial this is even more true when one consid that not all olymp athlet are abl to secur profit or even exagger contact an olymp archeri champion is less appeal than an olymp champion javelin thrower a femal javelin thrower is less appeal than a male sprinter and a champion sprinter is less appeal than an american elit basketbal player sporad media appear such as those dure the paralymp fortnight will hard suffic to land disabl athlet major contract an athlet has to be in the constant media and popular spotlight to secur lucrat contract until paralymp athlet are abl to achiev that kind of media presenc high sponsorship are like to elud them usa skier andrew earl kurka at the ____ ipc noram cup
wn mani countri provid feder money to support their olymp and paralymp athlet should the us consid this as a way of increas visibl for the paralymp support increas opportun for peopl with disabl and increas the us paralymp medal count
simon ličen focus on the us medal count will success keep the paralymp game away from mainstream attent a focus on the medal count as a mean to establish supremaci is typic for american profession sport and the paralymp will never be abl to beat the olymp game or the major leagu at their game this is whi the paralymp game should involv a differ narrat
countri typic alloc government support to the more vulner group in societi becaus those who are strong can protect their interest through their vast financi and social mean in this sens the unit state should support particip in the paralymp game to promot adapt sport in general and thus increas sport particip among peopl with disabl peopl with disabl are among those who most benefit from particip in sport and physic activ due to their health and social advantag howev they also have much fewer opportun for sport particip and often requir expens adapt sport equip public fund should contribut to their sport activ in general and feder fund of paralymp athlet could certain provid an excel exampl for local communiti unfortun i fear that even the most progress congresswomen/ENTITY and/ENTITY congressmen/ENTITY will be reluct to increas that fund given the current feder budgetari situat us congresswoman jacki speier comment about obamacar paralymp novemb _ ____ extern link us paralymp
