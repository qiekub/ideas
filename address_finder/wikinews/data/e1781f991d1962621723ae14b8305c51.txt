a new studi show that a variat in a gene known as the duffi antigen receptor for chemokin or simpli may introduc an unknown vulner that could lead to a __ greater risk of contract the precursor to the genet variat is found in twothird of subsaharan/ENTITY african/ENTITY this particular on the in which a singl genet letter is flip is thought to be a defens mechan against it stop the growth of the malariacaus parasit plasmodium/ENTITY vivax/ENTITY concurr it also caus protein secret by cell to avoid red/ENTITY blood/ENTITY cell/ENTITY an opposit behavior of the typic duffi gene
an ongo studi of african/ENTITY american/ENTITY has found that the group infect with was more like to lack red blood cell that host the duffi gene the studi publish in cell host microb doe not identifi whi the absenc of the chemokin in red blood cell increas suscept to hiv but the occurr of the virus in such peopl is beyond the level of chanc
the studi also found that those carri the darc variant live longer with hivaid while this come as good news to those alreadi infect it also mean that the window for the unwit spread of hiv is now known to be wider sinc infect individu with the gene mutat can take an averag of two year longer to show symptom in term of number the two year of unknow be a sourc for infect translat into as much as __ of aid/ENTITY case/ENTITY in/ENTITY africa/ENTITY
