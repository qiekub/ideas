tuesday august __ ____ grigori/ENTITY grisha/ENTITY perelman/ENTITY who is credit prove the poincaré/ENTITY conjectur/ENTITY declin to accept the field/ENTITY medal/ENTITY regard as the highest honor in the field of the field medal often refer to as the nobel/ENTITY prize/ENTITY of mathemat was award this year to andrei/ENTITY okounkov/ENTITY terenc/ENTITY tao/ENTITY australiaus and wendelin/ENTITY werner/ENTITY franc in addit to perelman the award was hand out by king/ENTITY juan/ENTITY carlo/ENTITY of/ENTITY spain/ENTITY and is accompani by a _____ approxim us_____ or _____eur cash prize less than the one million that come with the nobel prize nomine have to be under __ year becaus the founder of the award canadian mathematician john/ENTITY charl/ENTITY field/ENTITY want the medal to be a stimulus for futur endeavour
perelman submit two paper in ____ and ____ outlin a proof for thurston/ENTITY geometr/ENTITY conjectur/ENTITY which in turn impli a proof for the poincaré conjectur other mathematician fill in the detail have found no flaw in perelman approach yet in ____ perelman made a short tour in the unit state to explain his proof of the conjectur when he went back to the st/ENTITY petersburg/ENTITY depart of the steklov/ENTITY institut/ENTITY of/ENTITY mathemat/ENTITY he gave up his job and is report to be unemploy and live with his mother ever sinc
the reason perelman gave me is that he feel isol from the mathemat communiti and therefor has no wish to appear as one of it leader declar manuel de leon chairman of the congress when ask about grisha motiv to declin prof/ENTITY john/ENTITY ball/ENTITY retir presid of the intern mathemat union ad the reason centr on his feel of isol from the mathemat communiti perelman friend anatoli vershik said the reclus math genius just want to be declar correct and regard recognit as superfici

in ____ german alexand/ENTITY grothendieck/ENTITY refus his field medal in out of protest against the presenc of the red/ENTITY armi/ENTITY in eastern europ but later he accept it a _dimension sphere be project in _dspace
the poincaré conjectur is not an easi thing to explain in plain english a as we know it is call a sphere in topolog becaus it surfac can be approxim by a twodimension plane the fourdimension analogu of such a _sphere is a which is an exampl of a now imagin a ball and a donut made of rubber if you throw a lasso around the ball and pull you can squeez it to a singl point and slide off the lasso but you cant do that with the noos through the hole of a donut the onli way is to cut through the donut so in topolog there are basic two kind of object object with or without hole by deform object without hole you can make them look like a sphere but this is imposs for object with hole so basic grisha prove that in topolog a ball and a banana are the same
the poincaré conjectur surmis that if a close threedimension our multipledimens banana is suffici like a _sphere a kind of in that each in the manifold can be tighten to a point then it is realli just a threedimension sphere
