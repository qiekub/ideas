whi are you run for polit offic whi at the feder level whi this parti and whi in this ride
i am run for feder offic becaus i feel that is where i have the most to offer and where the issu that affect myself and my friend are the most signific i have chosen to run for the ndp becaus not onli is this a parti of strong leadership but also becaus i realli believ in the messag of the parti i am run in this ride becaus it is where i live and play
previous to this campaign have you been polit involv how will you appli your previous workvolunteerlif experi to serv your constitu
i have been polit activ almost my entir life as a student i was strong involv in fesfoth francophon student feder and when i move to this area i becam involv in the parti as a member of the ride associ execut
i have been work through the tech burst and know veri well how it has affect the peopl of this ride and this countri i also have a great deal of experi drive for what is right i have been refer to in my job as a pitbul becaus i dont give up on a problem or issu just becaus someon say that there is no easi solut usual the most difficult solut are also the most effect
as a member of toastmast i have learn an incred amount about speak share inform work as part of a team and provid strong leadership to my peer
through my work as a stage manag for music theater i have learn to wear mani hat at the same time build team friendship and strengthen group to achiev veri complex goal
as you campaign around your ride it like that some issu are mention more often by voter than other issu what would you say are the three hottest topic this elect in your ride what would you and your parti do to address these issu
the biggest issu around this ride and across the countri is the economi we see the economi as a blanket statement but at the end of the day for myself anyway i see the economi as be a question of whether or not i will have a job tomorrow for so mani peopl knowledg worker and other alik know that one might be out of work tomorrow caus an incred amount of stress on individu and their famili
the ndp has a strong plan to address the loss of job in this countri and i person have a plan to move our technolog sector forward by work with industri leader and communiti member train and skill advanc is the onli way that we as canadian will be abl to distinguish ourselv in the futur knowledg economi
are there ani misconcept about you your leader or your parti and platform
i dont know about ani misconcept about myself but mani peopl believ that the ndp doesnt have the drive or skill to run this countri that is absolut fals we have the depth of experi and passion to move this countri forward
there are more way than ever to get your messag out from the tradit campaign flier and lawn sign to new media like websit facebook and youtub the triedandtru rout get the messag out to the mass much easier but digit altern are much more measur in how mani are see or interact with your campaign what seem to be the most effect from your experi
so far ive been tri just about everyth it would seem that web page are current the way to go i have receiv mani comment question and kudo by peopl becaus they have seen the web page and know where to find us
i have receiv mani complaint this elect about the number of sign throughout the communiti and that bring me forward to question where exact this will lead in the futur i dont know do away with campaign sign sound like a good idea to me sinc they seem to be so wast
in this campaign we are experi with differ market techniqu that go along with flier but line up more toward a market campaign sinc we have the abil and technolog do do small run high qualiti document from the home whi not put those to use and tailor the messag to the audienc
