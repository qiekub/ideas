eilandhal websit was still oper monday at a mirror site url at the site eilandhal announc we won he gave beck wellwish as the comment is recov from wikinew can you describ a littl bit about yourself and your background and how you came to be interest in the glenn beck meme in the first place
isaac eilandhal ive been a comput geek sinc ____ when i was __ ive been on the internet sinc ____ among other job ive done technic support and web designhost ive gone back to school and im work on a degre in comput scienc if i manag that im think of follow up with a master in meteorolog if i had more courag id probabl tri to becom a profession storm chaser
i grew up as a veri fundamentalist southern baptist i got better my polit and social outlook has gone from veri conserv to veri liber one nice thing about this is that i understand both side a lot of liber scoff at the concept of chick tract for exampl and i do now but grow up i rememb believ in all that stuff i do have to remind myself that most christian are pretti moder in their outlook though sometim when i get a littl frustrat by some of the more vocal small group who would like the us to becom a christian theocraci
ive also becom frustrat with radic liber and conserv though as a liber youll be shock shock i say to find out that i see more conserv that fit the bill radic who i feel are tear this countri apart with their manipul and lie these extremist are push peopl toward the extrem and it polar and rip our nation apart it seem like nobodi want to compromis ani longer nobodi want to tri and work togeth everybodi want their parti to win at all cost becaus the other parti is the spawn of satan
the sad thing is the american peopl are lose in this battl republican are fight against govern interfer in busi democrat are or should be fight against busi interfer in govern ultim though special interest are pump so much money into the polit scene that it seem the voic of the peopl is lost in the nois of busi
it seem that the media especi the televis media have long ago figur out that the way to make their busi work which be commerci entiti they must of cours do as well as they can requir rate rate requir get peopl to watch get peopl to watch requir controversi and so peopl like glenn beck among mani other rise to becom star becaus they can get rate which ultim boil down to money the problem is that truth and compromis are bore but exagger and controversi are excit
when i saw the thread on fark where one of the poster in a thread about sarah palin announc her support for glenn beck said whi havent we had an offici respons to the rumor that glenn beck rape and murder a girl in ____ i didnt think too much of the post by itself but in the thread it immedi took off a bunch of peopl ran with it and it becam a hit in that thread it was actual the next day when i saw this thread and so mani peopl had said so mani funni thing it was like a relief
valv had open up and all this pent up frustrat was flow out
wn whi did you decid to creat the websit url
eh there was so much energi in the fark thread where the meme got it start i felt that it was someth worth continu that the frustrat that was
be express in that thread through the express of the meme might actual becom a forc for chang and even if it didnt manag to chang anyth just the simpl act of be a part of the meme might bring about a cathart releas of that frustrat at all the stupid of the pundit out there of whom i think that glenn beck is realli the worst of the worst
the thing about fark is it a great site but it all base on these thread someon submit a link and that give you a thread to talk about it after someth like __ day post is cut off also the site is made up of a lot of link for the public thread but mani time that for the privat thread it can be veri hard to keep up with a singl thread so i realiz that if this meme were to take off it need a home i knew i need to creat a websit and a forum on that websit to facilit whatev was go to happen
ultim the websit purpos was to shine a light on glenn beck style and to reflect it right back at him
wn how did you feel when you first found out that glenn beck had begun to take legal action with regard to your websit
eh well it certain didnt make me veri happi but at the same time it confirm what i suspect
it didnt make me happi becaus obvious nobodi like to be su it also made me unhappi becaus i saw it as a direct assault on free speech
of cours it confirm my suspicion that glenn beck claim to be a champion of the constitut are fals claim
wn whi did you regist altern domain name didglennbeckrapeandmurderayounggirlin____com and gb____com will you maintain the websit at those locat
eh as i said about the origin domain i want to regist the meme as the domain and that what i refer to as the statement domain the question domain came about becaus the entir concept of the meme is not to tri and convinc peopl that beck rape and murder but how the suppos rumour that he did is a direct parodi of the techniqu he himself use
i thought that the question form would serv the meme better so i went ahead and regist it and as soon as i did i chang the websit to the question instead of the statement in the titl and header for the page
when the domain disput was file i regist gb____com as well as gb____net i did this part becaus if he manag to get the question or statement domain taken down i would have a backup in place also it a lot easier to type gb____ than either of the long version so that was a part of it as well i made gb____com the primari domain for the websit and park the other two on top i put gb____net as a mirror on my second server in case someth happen to the first
wn you wrote in your novemb _ letter to beck it bear observ that by bring the wipo complaint you took what was mere one small critiqu meme in a sea of internet meme and turn it into a super meme media comment have written that beck action in the case trig the streisand/ENTITY effect/ENTITY do you think this happen here what do you mean when you say beck creat a super meme
eh i definit think the streisand effect came into play even befor i got the websit up and run farker had alreadi spread the meme ask question on yahoo answer for exampl so it definit got attent out there but the traffic to the site drop off drastic after the first coupl of day it wasnt until peopl post news about the legal threat to reddit fark digg and mani blog that i saw spike in traffic the major spike in traffic to the site have all come from updat about where the legal fight stood for exampl when a thread went green public on farkcom traffic to my server near overwhelm them for a coupl of hour when we post my brilliant lawyer marc randazza respons to the origin wipo complaint traffic was high for a coupl of day in each case it drop down to a relat low level when news was spars
i think that if beck had never start the legal action this meme would have die out after a coupl of week it might have pop up in the occasion place but i dont think it would have last the more than two month it has
by super meme i just mean that there are so mani meme out there some are specif to a certain site some have a veri short life and die quick some continu at a veri low level this meme howev just took off so mani peopl were post it on some mani unrel thread on fark that moder were ban peopl for it ive seen peopl post this meme in place where few meme go on news site blog anywher peopl comment this meme will pop up
wn you also wrote in your letter to beck in this context of this wipo case you denigr the letter of first amend law how would you like beck to act differ in the futur with regard to the first/ENTITY amend/ENTITY to/ENTITY the/ENTITY unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY constitut/ENTITY eh beck wipo complaint revolv around trademark issu his claim is that the domain violat the trademark he has in his name i dont believ that was his ultim motiv in tri to get the domain i think he was tri to stifl free speech i think he look at hustler v falwel and decid he couldnt win against my legallyprotect right to mock him but that he might be abl to use other mean to get my point of view shut down
it easi to come to this conclus if you look at the legal document i post on gb____netleg and i post everyth i got
what id like beck to do differ is simpli realiz that the chill effect of tri to have speech you disagre with shutdown would ultim
affect his right as well i disagre with mani of the thing he say and hope to put pressur on him to chang his techniqu but ultim i would never wish to stifl his first amend right there a differ between disagre with someon mock them and tri to intimid them to stop talk as regard the applic of the hustler v falwel case to this case i think the overal applic was fair parodi and satir are protect form of free speech wn in the final decis in the beck v eilandhal case the wipo arbitr cite the us suprem court case hustler magazin v falwel are you familiar with this suprem court case what are your thought on how it was appli to your case
eh i am familiar with the case and in fact it help me sleep at night dure the past coupl of month i think it is a veri import case on the topic of first amend right as regard parodi and satir i strong believ that humour should be use to point out the ridicul that one of the reason that the daili show is so popular and success they do it veri well
as regard the applic of the hustler v falwel case to this case i think the overal applic was fair parodi and satir are protect form of free speech
wn on septemb __ ____ your lawyer marc randazza request that glenn beck agre to stipul to the applic of the unit state constitut and also especi to the first amend to the us constitut in an octob __ interview with wikinew randazza said that beck had not respond to this request whi do you think beck chose not to stipul to the us constitut and the first amend in this case
eh i think beck knew that do so would hurt his case the right of free speech we enjoy in the unit state are broader than in some other countri wipo be an intern organ could well have assign an arbitr from a countri that doesnt protect speech as strong as we do and wipo not be bound by the us constitut might not choos to consid the strong protect we have in render their decis
we also felt it was iron that glenn beck who is on record as be against an intern bodi make judgment that might overrul the us constitut would himself choos to use an intern bodi to tri and stifl speech that would be protect under the us constitut so ultim you could say we were tri to help him retain the patriot imag he has work to hard to present
ultim the arbitr appli the first amend anyhow we felt that in send that letter we would give beck a chanc to show that his purport support for the constitut was real his failur to respond show everyon that he is full of shit we also felt it was iron that glenn beck who is on record as be against an intern bodi make judgment that might overrul the us constitut would himself choos to use an intern bodi to tri and stifl speech that would be protect under the us constitut wn an articl in onlin media daili note the decis in your wipo case appear to mark a signific win for digit right advoc becaus a rule in beck favor could have encourag other subject of onlin parodi to take their complaint direct to the wipo rather than us court which are bound by the first amend how do you feel about the fact that your case may have set preced for similar case in the futur
eh if this has truli set preced i am honor to have the chanc to serv the caus of liberti im nobodi special mind you anyon could have set up
a site it just happen to be me that got thrown in the center of this fight
when beck first file his wipo action i was readi to just give in to make thing easier for myself surrend is alway the easiest thing isnt it but i start to think about what the case meant it did occur to me that if beck succeed that his veri predict that he give on the air about intern bodi threaten our free speech right would come true i then realiz that the case was about much bigger principl
wn are you happi with your decis to turn over the url domain name to beck
eh absolut yes for one the meme is alreadi out there in one sens the job of the meme is over and done with it has gotten peopl to talk about the issu and that was one of the primari goal anoth primari goal was to foster that sens of communiti and to provid a releas valv for the frustrat so mani have with glenn beck and other like him of cours we want to keep the entir thing go but we can do that without the statement version of the domain
that domain get a lot of traffic i could have taken down the domain put up a pay per click site and made a heck of a lot of money by har the advertis revenu from the site it was in my financi best interest to do that but this was alway about free speech not about profit
i absolut think give him the domain send the messag that i want to send this wasnt person it was polit beck made it about free speech principl and i think i did my part to stand up for those principl but keep this particular domain wouldnt have advanc that caus ani further than it had alreadi been advanc
i want to give him the domain to demonstr the fact that my interest in fight the wipo case was pure a matter of principl
wn do you have ani thought or advic for other potenti creator of satir parodi websit who may undergo a similar legal process in the futur
eh if you decid to make a polit satir site do it be prepar to stick it out get a good lawyer who is commit to first amend principl who know how to handl this kind of thing but get one who will teach you and make sure that you are abl to make inform decis
there were a lot of lawyer to choos from but mr randazza seem to be the best guy for this kind of case his first amend credibl is unshak his knowledg of this area of law is fantast but he has a reput for manag his client interest realli well he didnt tell me what to do he taught me what the law was he gave me option and choic and let me make inform decis in a process like this it is easi to feel like thing are out of your control make sure your lawyer teach you about what you can control it will make you feel a lot more comfort
wn are there ani other point regard the beck v eilandhal case that you would like to elabor or explain
eh although the vast major of email and voicemail ive receiv are from folk that clear get the joke there are so mani peopl that didnt if there anyon out there who still think the point was to tri and get peopl to believ that glenn beck rape and murder a young girl in ____ pleas understand that ive tri to make it as clear as i could that it just not true the entir point is that the suppos rumour is so overthetop as to be ridicul further i have alway had a disclaim on the site explain that it was a parodi the welcom blurb has alway said that we dont believ the rumour is true the entir point is that were tri to point out techniqu weve seen beck himself use
one thing that has amus me is that some of the folk who dont get that have come into the forum and tri to respond by attack obama becaus that what they feel the respons to the suppos rumour should be sometim ive been success in explain how this realli isnt the same thing but sometim it just doesnt work
the other thing i would like to clarifi is that i have not made a singl cent from this in fact i have spent probabl more than i could afford to on the whole project i also didnt want or expect the __ minut of fame i got i dont have ani regret it been fun in some respect mind but if i was out for fame or money this would not be the method id choos
