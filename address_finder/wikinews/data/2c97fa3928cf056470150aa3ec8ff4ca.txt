i ran for the green parti initi for one reason peak oil it was and still is an issu that is tremend serious but is not given enough attent i believ it will in fact be the issu of this centuri but i have learn sinc then that there are mani other serious relat issu such as climat chang that need to be tackl in an invent way use an approach that reli on ingenu and take in a differ perspect to the problem and approach that look at the entir system and it relationship to other problem rather than look at each problem as if it were isol we also need to look at problem use longrang think and not simpli concentr on the quickfix

i have the most through grasp of the issu that will truli affect the popul in the longterm and understand what need to be done to help mitig the worst affect of them the other candid are run to get elect and will say whatev is necessari to bring them into a posit where peopl will vote for them even if they do not person believ in all aspect of their own parti polici or platform i do on the other hand thorough believ in the green parti valu from which we base our polici and platform and will alway work toward achiev them
what do you feel are the three most import issu to voter in your ride are these the same top three issu that are most import to you what would you do to address these issu
the voter believ that transport increas transiteas gridlock school fund faithbas statusquo or merg the two system and urban intensif develop are the three most import issu along with health care access to doctor be of general concern
person the issu of transport and develop are veri close interlink with the issu of health and energi they are all a consequ of our addict to oil and to our energyintens lifestyl we are live further and further from where we work shop and play yet we insist on drive everywher to do everyth not realli becaus there are no option but becaus this is general the most conveni way to do it given the circumst under which we insist on live much of our problem are a consequ of our built environ and our fixat on design our live environ to accommod automobil
mani of our health problem are a consequ of our sedentari and conveniencebas servicebasedfastfood lifestyl as well as the stress we are put on our bodi in various way includ through chemic load and selfinduc mental stress among other
i believ that we need to rapid wean ourselv from the one thing which make our live so conveni pollut our environ with toxic chemic sour our air allow us to pave over our best farmland and expand outward incess in a manic urg to grow our economi for no other reason than to expand for the sake of expans oil the discoveri of the power of oil has been on of the greatest asset to mankind this millennium but we are at a junctur in human histori where oil is now becom our nemesi and is no longer make our live better no further improv to our lifestyl can be had be increas the number of peopl drive nor by increas the number of hous be built for we are pave over our veri best farmland where we will need to grow more of our food in the notsodist futur andor destroy essenti habitat that is necessari to maintain the proper function of our ecosystem nor by increas the densiti of hous for this onli increas the concentr of the pollut and increas the burden on our infrastructur includ road transit water sewer electr and other essenti servic we need to undertak a crashcours in energi conserv while at the same time look at restor the proper function of both our human and natur ecosystem in order to come back into balanc with the natur world includ the human mind abil to accommod our massiv presenc this requir a new set of think which i believ mani member of the green parti have start to grasp and understand and is reflect in both our valu and our polici
the green parti in essenc is attempt to bring a measur of direct and purpos back into the polit realm by reestablish a set of base valu from which we can move forward and agre upon as common goal for human societi and this i believ is where the elector is miss the point
what should be the first order of busi in the __th legisl assembl
my prioriti if elect would be to halt all expans new develop on our more essenti land and work at bring in a form of land valu taxat
are the properti tax in your ride at a fair level for the amount of servic receiv in the municip
no properti tax are like not high enough for the new develop for they are a burden on the downstream or upstream servic like the electr water and sewer network the initi develop charg were not high enough to cover all of the cost of expand servic for these new develop so it is like that tax rate would need to be higher for the newer develop howev we also now have a situat where the older develop are undergo the slow decay of their built infrastructur which will potenti requir a complet overhaul of their servic primarili water and sewag system but also road and other hard infrastructur which may requir the intervent of the provinc to assist these communiti in undertak upgrad
how can the provinc lead the way in stimul job creation
the provinc must vocal and monetarili encourag a shift in the direct we are head with respect to the manufactur sector our relianc on the tradit automobil manufactur sector for a larg chunk of our economi can onli be detriment to the prospect for job as the entir industri haemorrhag in north america for lack of innov we need to diversifi our economi into new energi technolog and valuead good and servic rather than take a narrow view and onli make our provinc attract to investor and reli on corpor to provid the employ opportun the govern should becom much more proactiv in help to establish new compani by provid seed money and busi expertis where necessari to encourag entrepreneur to move faster toward creat the infrastructur necessari to make our societi more sustain
what are your view on the mix member proport represent mmp referendum
i am complet in favour of the system mmp will guarante green represent at queen park someth that is long overdu
what role if ani doe new media play in your campaign and the campaign of your parti websit blog facebook youtub video etc do you view it as benefici or a challeng
i have a person websit although i do not have a veri techsavvi webmast and becaus of it generic structur intend for use by multipl candid if not particular flexibl nor impress attract i use facebook on occas and have use it to connect with peopl dure this campaign but i have not use a blog nor have i use youtub
of the decis made by ontario __th legisl assembl which was the most benefici to your elector district to the provinc as a whole which was least benefici or even harm to your this ride to the provinc as a whole
the most benefici decis made by the former liber govern was the greenbelt act flow close by the place to grow act these were monument achiev although they could alway have done better these help somewhat to reign in the outward growth of our communiti yet these were also detriment to us in some respect sinc they inadvert gave the green light to develop to expand as rapid as possibl to the edg of the boundari set up under these act urban intensif has also becom a burden on our infrastructur includ road intens traffic water hydraul pressur drop sewer now reach close to capac and electr system the schedul for shut down the coal plant has been delay yet again among mani other
for the provinc as a whole i believ that the pass of the standard offer contract legisl which allow for smallscal local renew energi to be sold back to the electr grid at a premium price is one of the most proactiv piec of legisl the provinc has pass in a while although a serious popular educ campaign and govern support network to help peopl work through the necessari regul need to take place so that peopl individu can be given a chanc to take advantag of the offer
the most disappoint act was portion of the ____ provinci park and conserv reserv act which allow the vast major of protect area to remain open to sport hunt ___ protect area permit this activ to go on within park boundari consid that the major of crown land is alreadi open to sport hunt more than __ continu to allow an activ that is harm to wildlif and ecosystem within park boundari is onli perpetu the problem of speci declin in ontario
