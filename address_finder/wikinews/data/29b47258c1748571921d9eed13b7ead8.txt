q much of brampton exist council is quit season in the civic polit process what could you bring to the tabl as a rooki abov and beyond the current roster of councillor
a the one thing that i would do differ from the incumb is to make sure that i involv the communiti in the decis make process and educ them about municip servic ward _ and _ where i am a candid have the biggest influx of immigr in brampton i had a chanc to meet most of them over the summer and they know veri littl about the citi they live in therefor they presum that all is fine and that everyth will fall in place as a councilor in ward _ and _ my role would be to educ the communiti so that they can becom more proactiv in help us deliv the servic that are most suitabl for them most peopl were also quick to point out that it was the first time anyon from the municip govern had actual knock at their door if elect i would make sure to close that gap which current exist between the major of the resid of ward _ and _ and there councilor i believ to close this gap requir a fresh pair of eye and that is what i intend to bring to the tabl as an elect councilor
q the rose theatr recent launch what are your thought on this facil have you had a chanc to tour it yet
a the rose theatr is a magnific build and it a step in the right direct brampton downtown need sever other project that would attract busi and improv the general profil of the citi so often resid of brampton have to commut to toronto if they want to catch a good show and have a relax even if we can offer that right here in brampton then we can keep the dollar within the local economi creat job
q the provinc has strong encourag the develop of highdens resid near the downtown do these build fit in with your vision of the downtown how much say should other level of govern have in urban plan
a all level of govern have to work togeth as the same taxpay fund them all i believ that highdens resid in the downtown locat make sens given the proxim to the transit rout plan for the futur this would also bring more busi in an area that realli need rejuven

q whi should busi be attract to locat in brampton
a one of the thing that i would do to protect the environ would be to attract new busi and encourag the plan of smart communiti current the major of resid in ward _ and _ in brampton have to drive to the nearest groceri store and commut long distanc to their place of work in futur we should plan communiti where groceri store and other amen are within walk distanc to the major of the resid we should also attract new busi in the area to avoid the long commut for most resid henc reduc the amount of gasolin consum and the infrastructur requir to accommod all the traffic anoth import point is to design communiti that are bus and transit friend current one has to walk far to catch the bus in brampton and it equal import to note that the citi has so far not build the major of the bus shelter dure raini day resid get realli soak which i am sure would be a major deterr to would be transit commut
