what insipr you to get behind geekcorp and has there been a big geekcorp mission yet
i got interest in geekcorp becaus id live in ghana as a student in ____ and ____
while over there i was amaz at just how littl internet connect was avail
i did a bit of volunt work help wire an environment organ but basic the onli peopl who had regular net access were us embassi employe
so i was fascin to learn that my friend in ghana were get onlin in the late ____s and i wonder whether anyon would start build netbas busi as peopl were do in the us
my wife and i went back to ghana to visit friend and found that there was a huge deal of enthusiasm about the web and the potenti it repres but almost no expertis
peopl were realli desper to learn but veri few peopl were abl to teach at the same time i was readi to step down from tripod and i knew a lot of burn out geek
i start wonder whether some of my friend would be interest in share their skill in the develop world and whether that would be a use thing to do
lot of intern develop folk seem to think it was a good caus so i start work on it fulltim
we end up send about ___ peopl oversea over the four year i was involv with the project
we usual sent about __ to a countri at a time work with a varieti of busi ngos and govern agenc biggest project were in ghana mali mongolia seneg
with geekcorp you push the idea that newli techsavvi citizen of develop countri could start onlin busi to do digit work for the develop world but from an american perspect that outsourc the bane of us worker how do you justifi work toward a goal that might cost american their job
basic im concern about the abil of peopl all over the world to make a good live send their children to school build nice hous have enough food and clean water etc there clear someth of a tradeoff offer by all sort of global as million of chines are lift out of rural poveri industri manufactur job in the us disappear but the us has a pretti good histori of innov and creat new job in field that requir a lot of intellectu endeavor the us continu to found interest softwar compani pioneer new net servic and general do a lot of the interest develop on the cut edg of tech i think a lot of routin code job are up for outsourc but i dont think that peopl who design softwar or who manag the outsourc and softwar develop process are go away ani time soon it veri hard to outsourc creativ activ it somewhat easier to outsourc repetit process
i think we need to worri less about individu job loss and more about the abil to continu creat new project at the same time im veri excit to see compani in the develop world move up the valu chain as well start to innov and creat new project as well
late youv been involv with project includ global voic and worldchang where and how do the two dovetail and where and how do they differ what are the strength of each
theyr veri differ project and communiti wc is a magazin it a chanc for a small group of smart peopl to write origin content on green issu it a lot less global than gv perhap over focus on the us and europ and has a tight subject focus gv is an edit aggreg peopl are not so much write origin opinion content on gv as they are link to other content inde we ask peopl to tri veri hard not to be especi opinion on gv not npov but a similar perspect you point you dont advoc
ethanz also gvo is huge __ region editor about __ regular contributor a network of about a thousand blog we regular link to the communiti has a veri differ feel much more intern more ___ both are fascin project success in their own way but quit differ on the tech issu a littl in both case were take veri simpl weblog tool and ask them to support veri larg communiti and a littl bit on the issu of how they interfac with mainstream media in both case were interest in amplifi meme and get them pick up by popular press as well as on the web
isnt that a contradict your ask peopl to be less opinion but not ask them to be unopinion
blog are essenti about opinion ask for npov in the blog space miss the point we want to know what opinion peopl in syria have but we want our middl east editor to tri to fair repres the differ opinion take place in that space that said hes got an opinion as well so ask for npov isnt the right thing to do ask him to point to a divers of opinion is in our case
geekcorp can be found onlin at and global voic onlin is at
