tuesday octob _ ____ john/ENTITY c/ENTITY mather/ENTITY georg/ENTITY f/ENTITY smoot/ENTITY lawrenc/ENTITY berkeley/ENTITY nation/ENTITY laboratori/ENTITY share the ____ nobel/ENTITY prize/ENTITY for/ENTITY physic/ENTITY for their discoveri of the blackbodi form and anisotropi of the cosmic/ENTITY microwav/ENTITY background/ENTITY the famous map of the cmbe anisotropi creat use cobe data
the nobel prize committe cite the physicist for their work on the cosmic/ENTITY background/ENTITY explor/ENTITY cobe project cobe reveal fluctuat in faint microwav signal from space that are thought to be remnant of the big/ENTITY bang/ENTITY although the precis origin of the fluctuat in the cosmic microwav background is not yet clear they may repres clump in the veri earli univers that led to the galaxi seen today
prior to the cobe map of the univers it was unclear whi the univers contain star and galaxi rather than an even distribut dust cloud theorist had predict that a sensit measur of microwav from the sky would reveal minut temperatur fluctuat which repres variat in the densiti of matter in the earli univers the denser portion serv as seed for galaxi that form later cobe was the first experi sensit enough to confirm the predict temperatur variat encod in the map of the microwav background
the initi discoveri of the cosmic microwav background by arno/ENTITY penzia/ENTITY robert/ENTITY wilson/ENTITY led to their award of the ____ nobel prize in physic although they measur the approxim temperatur of the univers to be about __ kelvin their groundbas microwav telescop could not pick out the detail avail to cobe
