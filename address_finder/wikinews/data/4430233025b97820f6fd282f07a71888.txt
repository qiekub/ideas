ds ralph abernathi ralph/ENTITY abernathi/ENTITY the director nation of oper/ENTITY breadbasket/ENTITY jess/ENTITY jackson/ENTITY who was in his late twenti earli thirti it was interest becaus jess jackson age and my age gap was the same as his and king jackson at that time had a big afro and a medallion he becam a hero to me adam clayton powel who had been my hero had retir and move so i becam a protégé of reverend jackson we becam close
jame brown a father to sharpton what i do function is what dr king reverend jackson and the movement are all about but i learn manhood from jame brown i alway say that jame brown taught me how to be a man
ds are you still close to reverend jackson
as yeah we talk in ____ when jackson left over whatev their problem were with each otherthat when he left to form oper pushi also left the sclc in protest becaus i was close to reverend jackson i took my youth divis with me and form nation/ENTITY youth/ENTITY movement/ENTITY which was my organ jess didnt have an organ here in new york when i form it mayb about a year six month later a young guy join the organ from he would come up here think about go to colleg name teddi teddi father was jame brown teddi got kill in a car accid in upstat new york he and i were the same age sixteen jame brown came to new york and the disc jockey here told him about this young preacher his son like he decid hed do a memori concert for his son for my youth group he talk to me he like me and of cours this was like the icon he becam like the father i didnt have after my parent separ and i becam like teddi his ambiti young son he had other kid but they were not as old as teddi and they didnt have the ambit so we start a fatherson relationship
ds how did jame brown death affect you
as oh i dont think anyth has affect me more
ds he was such an icon but then to also have had this deepli person relationship must have had an extraordinari impact on you
as jame brown was the father i never had i travel with him he financ my youth group i met my wife were no longer togeth when she was his background singer he put my kid in privat school i style my hair after him he actual style my hair after his what i do function is what dr king reverend jackson and the movement are all about but i learn manhood from jame brown i alway say that jame brown taught me how to be a man
ds what was one lesson that he taught you
as determin dont be afraid to listen to your inner ear jame brown chang music he chang the beat of music i learn from him to trust your inner ear go by your own beat i rememb in the ____s when disco becam popular he refus to water down his music and it end up his music becam the basi of funk and rap and all that i watch him deal with advers and go to jail when he was in jail i went and saw him everi month and i went and preach for him he never gave up he was veri determin he taught me how to take advers and use it to your advantag ds there is so much anger at injustic and that anger can fell a person abil to right wrong or can steer them down a bad path you have been abl to take your anger and use it product when you come across a young person who is angri at the world around them what kind of advic do you give them
as the challeng is to learn that your anger can fuel you in achiev thing that can erad what your angri about or your anger can consum and defeat you im known for fight racial bias polic misconduct and thing against poor peopl i can either be strateg to say this is plan a b and c to get racial profil off or hate crime law pass or close the navi/ENTITY base/ENTITY in/ENTITY viequ/ENTITY and im go to use my anger my real heartfelt anger to fuel me to get up at five oclock in the morn to do plan a b and c or i can be someon so angri that i never get to a strategi i never get to plan a b and c but then the polic are not challeng and the hate crime law are not written and is still open so the question one has to ask one selfi tell young peopl all the time and most of the nation/ENTITY action/ENTITY network/ENTITY leadership in our chapter are younger than meyou have to make a choic at some point in your life are you go to do someth about what anger you or do you want to just be angri becaus i learn a long time ago that those in power dont care that your angri they care if you use that anger to do someth about it you have a choic i use to like box my father was a boxer and i use to watch box match all the time if you go into the ring just mad youll get knock out or you can go into the ring and have train and have a fight plan and use your natur anger to fuel your fight plan it accord to what you want to be but the one with the fight plan that use his anger to drive the fight plan is the one who end up champion the one without one just end up angri and lay knock out it your choic im not say i came to that out of brillianc i came to that out of trial and error i use to be angri with no plan just reckless angri
ds what would you do
as just mad just react and achiev noth youv got to say that life is about state goal benchmark and what you want to achiev at the end of life becaus everybodi come to an end what was the purpos of your life and what did you achiev so if my goal was to build a social justic network and to chang thing at the end of life in the social justic arena did i do that it wont matter if i was angri or happi it will matter if i have achiev that that what i learn from jame brown you got to decid what your purpos is not other much of the media critic of me assum their goal and the impos them on me well those might not be my goal so they will say well sharpton has not won a polit offic but that might not be my goal mayb i ran for polit offic to chang the debat or to rais the social justic question
ds which you see today denni/ENTITY kucinich/ENTITY tom/ENTITY tancredo/ENTITY theyr not there becaus they think they are go to win they are tri to frame the issu
as right and if they are there to frame the issu then they are success one of the thing i learn from jame brown is dont let other determin your success your success is base upon your goal not the goal they impos upon you
critic sharpton is alway there
ds a lot of the critic that is lodg at you is that you alway seem to pop up around hot button issu or where there is some race issu my interview with you came up dure my thanksgiv dinner with my famili and id like that dinner to inform our discuss becaus it illustr mani of the typic perspect about you my brotherinlaw made that point that there you alway are around the controversi race issu i respond with well what was he say was he wrong about what he said whi do we focus on sharpton and not the issu he is talk about
as your answer is right but let me give you someth even deeper than that if you ask the averag critic where is he imus whatev you know what they wont recogn not onli was i there but i creat it into be an issu there was no jena until we went into jena there was nobodi els fight imus the misconcept is these these issu got hot and then i came in no i came in and i made them hot there was nobodi in jena nobodi heard of jena until we went down there nobodi ever question imus but us which is whi imus came to our show the reason whi this becom import is becaus not onli are you right do you disagre with him but do you begrudg him be in front of an issu that he help creat so who is suppos to be in front of it i creat an issu and then somebodi els is suppos to lead it last friday we had a huge _____ person march in washington against the justic depart we went out there organ with our chapter got ___ buse from around the countri paid for who is suppos to lead the march you got peopl say there he is lead the march well he organ it who is suppos to lead the march and the thing that get me is you get blame for stuff you did not do a lot of peopl think i led the/ENTITY duke/ENTITY case/ENTITY i never went to duke i never went to north carolina never ever they ask me to come but i said unless i talk to the victim im not go so you get critic for what you do organ and lead and you get critic for stuff you had noth to do with just becaus peopl assum you were there and it crazi ds nadin strossen the presid of the aclu brought up in our interview that their critic intent distort their work to serv their own purpos for instanc mani peopl believ the aclu work to keep religion out of the school yet they have consist fought for the right for religion to be in school she debat falwel and robertson on these issu and they will still say that the aclu is fight to remov god from the public sphere
as shes right that not their posit
ds when you come across peopl who intent misinform the debat in order to scuttl your goal what do you do
as the onli thing you can do is straighten the record out but you come to expect it the advantag i have is that i grew up in the movement and watch peopl from reverend jackson to jame brown jame brown as the domin father in my life jackson as the domin teacher who had to deal with the same misconcept and controversi when it came my time i almost expect it becaus that is what they are go to do which is to tri and chang the debat what you learn is you dont let them chang the premis becaus if you start with the wrong premis you arriv at the wrong conclus ill give you an exampl a guy say to me the other day in an airport i admir you but id like to see you on more than civil right issu i said let me ask you a question what do i do he said well you lead a civil right organ so what am i suppos to do that like get on a plane and tell the pilot id like to see you do more than fli the plane that what i doim a civil right leader what is a civil right leader suppos to do
ds that the same respons ingrid newkirk gave in an interview when i told her peopl say she care more about fight for anim than for human she respond that what peta doe give a voic to those who do not have one she said that critic is like tell a homeless shelter they care more about the homeless than peopl who live in mansion
as that exact right i tell staff here and all the other citi where we have offic dont complain when peopl come in here with problem becaus that what you do that like a nurs say whi do sick peopl come here becaus you work in a doctor offic whi do peopl who are in troubl go to a lawyer offic becaus that what lawyer do that what i do civil right so in mani way what they consid critic is compliment my job an activist job is to make public civil right issu until there can be a climat for chang so when peopl get angri at me for rais these issu and make them public well that my job that what im suppos to do if i could not get the public attent on an issu then im not a good activist
tawana brawley to megan william
ds are you tire of hear tawana/ENTITY brawley/ENTITY alway pair with your name
as no you know what happen it has been so longtwenti yearsthat when a lot of peopl back up on that other realiz how ludicr it is they say wait a minut you have to go back twenti year to critic him and he believ in a girl that you dont believ in so twenti year later now and the same thing happen to megan/ENTITY william/ENTITY in/ENTITY west/ENTITY virginia/ENTITY was that a hoax when you look at the span of my career from howard/ENTITY beach/ENTITY befor brawley to sean/ENTITY bell/ENTITY now if all you can do is go to one case twenti year ago then most peopl would say that is a littl shaki i mean come on becaus if i was a hoaxster then whi havent we seen other hoax in twenti year and whi didnt the juri say they thought it was a hoax the juri said they didnt believ should have been label the same juri that hit us with defam that juri said there was no conspiraci to lie which is whi they onli award him _____ from me if they thought it was a hoax i would have been indict for conspiraci and i would have been charg with a whole lot more money in mani way i learn to just sit back and laugh becaus if you have to go back to ____ in ____ that mean i have a pretti good record i disagre with the grand juri on brawley i believ there was enough evid to go to trial grand juri said there wasnt okay fine do i have a right to disagre with the grand juri mani american believ oj/ENTITY simpson/ENTITY was guilti a juri said he wasnt so i have as much right to question a juri as they do al sharpton on tawana brawley
ds how would ____ al sharpton have handl the tawana brawley case differ than ____ al sharpton
as i probabl wouldnt have made it as person in term of person attack on the attorney general but i would still have fought the case i would have done the same case i would have stood up the same way and i do it the same way now when we are approachedphon ring everi day here with casesw are not the investig we are there to make sure there is a fair investig and i would have done the same thing then i do now not long ago a writer said to me how can you believ a girl is apprehend by four white men with the written on her and all of that i told him let me tell you a stori i heard that sound even wors i heard of a guy who was grab and brought to a polic station and they stuck a pole up his behind and no cop would stop them and turn them in he said that ludicr and i said that abner/ENTITY louima/ENTITY and it happen i fought that case and those cop went to jail so in my world who decid what the most bizarr stori in the world is we hear these everi day he say i never thought about it like that megan william right now is tawana brawley what are we talk about ill give you anoth exampl five young black kid were arrest and charg for rape a white femal in central park i defend them thirteen year later we find out that they did not do it the clear them one of them work for us now so how do you know onli by continu to fight for what you believ in
ds you are say that when you becom involv you are fight to ensur that there is a fair investig into whatev has happen and that sometim you are pair with the fact that not everyth turn out in favor of the person be investig
as that exact right you get the downsid like the brawley juri didnt believ her ill give you one wors amadou diallou was kill fortyon bullet the juri said they werent guilti hes still dead so on paper was i wrong about amadou diallo hes dead fortyon bullet kill him but the juri said that those cop were right so when do we decid my comeback alway is i disagre with the grand juri on brawley i believ there was enough evid to go to trial grand juri said there wasnt okay fine do i have a right to disagre with the grand juri mani american believ oj/ENTITY simpson/ENTITY was guilti a juri said he wasnt so i have as much right to question a juri as they do doe it make somebodi a racist no they just disagre with the juri so did i i happen to not believ a fifteen year old girl could have made all that up and guess the name of the peopl who admit they were togeth i just dont believ that now what happen i dont know but i dont believ that so well just disagre
sharpton and the africanamerican media earl/ENTITY ofari/ENTITY hutchinson/ENTITY recent wrote a relat laudatori column about you in the/ENTITY huffington/ENTITY post/ENTITY in it he said when sharpton toppl jess jackson from the top spot as black america main man the notorieti and the hostil that that titl carri with it insur that hed take the heat for whatev went right or wrong when black took to the street in protest what do you think happen to jess jackson place in the black communiti hutchison is a promin black man say you toppl jackson
as well that a hard thing for me to comment on when i was grow up reverend jackson was a hero to me and a mentor id rather not get into that ill let earl and other give their opinion ill stay out of that that difficult for me to answer the main thing black columnist write about is critic of black leader if you read their column you understand what their job is white leadership is never at fault govern is never at fault it black leader al sharpton
ds clarenc page again in refer to this wrote cultur punish those who dont stop/ENTITY snitch/ENTITY to quot a popular innerc tshirt slogan even when the victim are innoc neighbor a lot of us black american would like to take back our street we could use a littl more help from our leader
as we could use a littl more help from clarenc page again when i had the campaign against these lyricsi had the it not snitch it save campaignclar was total silent weve taken that head on and had rapper attack us david/ENTITY banner/ENTITY said al sharpton can suck my soandso has a record out and hes a friend of mine he say dont tell me al sharpton not to say they dont attack clarenc page they attack me becaus im attack them just look at the rapper attack me so somebodi should ask clarenc page whi they are attack me if im not out there fight them
ds you are say that black columnist whether it be clarenc page or juan william who seem to have made their name by attack a lot of the work done at the grass root how can you chang that
as i dont think you can that their role if you go back to the sixti it was carl/ENTITY rowan/ENTITY who use to attack martin luther king you have black who understand that one of the way to get a job in the mainstream media is to attack black leader
ds such as juan william
as oh juan/ENTITY william/ENTITY who work at juan william work for rupert/ENTITY murdoch/ENTITY and want to ask me about account i mean realli he work for rupert murdoch and want to ask me about account i think he was mad becaus a republican donat some money to the nation action network and you work for rupert murdoch becaus we are on the/ENTITY word/ENTITY network/ENTITY we should have gone to a ralli for the word network it ridicul again what do they do the main thing they write about is critic of black leader if you read their column you understand what their job is white leadership is never at fault govern is never at fault it black leader what iron is the one they do prais bill/ENTITY cosbi/ENTITY doe my radio show mayb onc a month real close with me they prais cosbi but never talk about the fact that cosbi and i work togeth on these veri issu and cosbi support what i do how do they reconcil that becaus they understand that part of their compact with the right wing is that theyll beat up on al sharpton or jackson or whoever becaus they are black
whi the need for an al sharpton
ds at thanksgiv we were talk about the differ voic for differ communiti and i said that there is no al sharptonth cuban use to have jorg/ENTITY mas/ENTITY canosa/ENTITY but nobodi has taken his placenor is there an al sharpton with the black communiti it seem like american are alway look for the voic do you think that your visibl has been extern impos
as no i disagre with that im glad you had that discuss do you know whi i disagre with you in the latino communiti you dont have an al sharpton you have la/ENTITY raza/ENTITY everi communiti doe have an organ or institut so number one that not true second in the black communiti
ds but there no one voic it seem like the other never have a singular voic
as yeah but that one voic is alway the head of some group believ me if i could not prove that we could deliv the bodi to these protest the press wouldnt cover me the onli reason the press cover me is we creat the issu the press ignor jena until we put _____ peopl down there so if we have the organiz muscl they arent do me a favor the white media didnt creat me they cover me when i went to howard beach there were hundr out there and they threw banana at us and all the press didnt contact me and say well tell you what sharpton you go out there and well cover you no i creat the drama like king did in selma alabama so what they are realli say is let be select becaus if we dont like sharpton let not cover sharpton becaus we want somebodi els usual even the black critic that critic charismat leadership are black without who cant do it themselv weve alway had charismat leadership whether it was mandela in south africa or king in the south the question is what you use the charismat leadership for what wrong with that
ds shane johnson is an africanamerican blogger who was protest your washington dc depart of justic march clarenc/ENTITY page/ENTITY who is one of your critic within the africanamerican communiti wrote a column about it he wrote whi do we black folk get so much more agit about occasion whiteonblack insult than about the blackonblack assault that constant terror certain neighborhood
as my answer is whi doesnt clarenc page do someth about it when we everyday deal with that that is dealt with everi day and everi way not onli have we dealt with black on black assault not onli do we do crime ralli not onli do we denounc it weve even been the one to go as far as to march on black rapper about the nword misogyni and violenc to women that a lot of them glorifi clarenc page and them dont do that we do my critic were total silent when we were march on the rapper the record compani and all of that this summer but when i do a march they critic well where were they when we were march on some of these rapper who glorifi violenc that whi they have no credibl in our communiti becaus we are march on the record compani that glorifi violenc we are march on black on black violenc they are not they wait for us to do an issu that is racebas and act like that all we did we spent half this year fight lyric in record the glorif of violenc drug in our communiti im the one who paint the crackhous say get them out of our communiti where was clarenc and them then
ds is get your messag out that you do more than just racebas issu a challeng you have difficulti overcom that all that peopl hear and see you do
as well that one of the challeng but part of the problem is guy who are critic wont tell the truth if you were to ask them they know weve march against record compani they wont cover them becaus they knowparticular a lot of black columnistsbecaus that the way they can be heard to be against whoever is out there they did it to jess befor me and they did it to king befor him you know one of the way you can get cover if you are black in the mainstream media is to attack the guy that is up front make him the boogeyman i accept that go in
al sharpton and presidenti polit
ds recent a poll came out that show sixtyon percent of the black american survey said valu between poor and middleclass black are move too far apart to be view as a common black experi onli __ percent express that view in a similar ____ poll do you think the black experi is no longer defin by race but by socioeconom status but do you know what nobodi ever talk about im the onli black who ran for presid who had to run against anoth black carol/ENTITY mosley/ENTITY braun/ENTITY abov jess never had to face a black shirley chisholm never had to face a black obama hasnt had to face a black the real question is whi did sharpton get so mani more vote than carol mosleybraun who on paper was a much better candid
as no i think it was alway divid on socioeconom status i think that there is a grow socioeconom differ that bring the contrast more to light but that all come togeth around the question of civil right there no differ there ani number of poll that show that most black no matter what their class say that there is still bias in america whether you are a kid in jena from a poor famili or a colleg professor at columbia with noos hang on your door you still have a race problem you may have a differ in view about valu but both of you still feel there is bias at whatev class level you are at that is whi they were shock when i ran for presid and the black eliteth bob/ENTITY johnson/ENTITY who own and earl greywer some of the biggest contributor to my campaign becaus they said we still have to have somebodi out there fight race let me give you the schizophrenia of the polit anim when i ran for presid i won everi black district in washington dc i then won the black vote in south carolina when i never was from the south but do you know what nobodi ever talk about im the onli black who ran for presid who had to run against anoth black carol mosley braun jess never had to face a black shirley/ENTITY chisholm/ENTITY never had to face a black obama hasnt had to face a black the real question is whi did sharpton get so mani more vote than carol mosley braun who on paper was a much better candid former us senat former ambassador and she never got anywher near my vote it show that black vote base on who they think support their interest now you are talk about obama has to fight hillari for the black vote i had to fight carol mosley braun for the black vote and beat her everywher i think that is the analysi they dont want to give theyll say sharpton didnt get the vote that jess got but they never mention there was a black womanth onli black woman who ever serv in the us senaterun against sharpton they forget that now
ds what did you learn about nation polit from your presidenti run
as ill tell you i will be complet candid with you i learn these guy are not that smart i expect them to be a lot smarter a lot more difficult to debat and i learn a lot of them onli have the valu system of win win win they dont believ in anyth obvious i ran to put forth a polit posit and to make visibl a constitu and obvious mani of them didnt but i thought they had some core belief most of them didnt have core belief
ds is there one moment that stick out in your mind
as probabl but let me get back to that i also learn that onc most american and i talk that we didnt disagre that much when i was campaign in iowa and new hampshiretot white communitiesthat the more we talk not onli did they get more comfort with me i got more comfort with them becaus peopl realli dont disagre on fundament as much as the disagre on the stuff weve been program to disagre on with each other
ds the way it present in the media
as correct peopl would say to me now that i hear you even if i disagre with you i dont think your as bad as i thought i would say let me ask you a question what was bad as you thought and they couldnt say they dont know whi they think your bad they just know your suppos to be bad becaus the right wing tell them your bad
ds it seem the mediaboth liber and conservativeha to follow a narrat
as exact so even my wors criticismbrawleytel me what is wrong with a civil right leader believ a __ year old girl who came to him i didnt tell her the stori she told me what was wrong about that i guess noth did you know she was lie a juri didnt know she said that i didnt know what her stori was so in your wors scenario the lack of discours is what separ most american i learn that more than anyth in the campaign when i would meet with a lot of the handler and dnc offici about the campaign and everyth was gear toward poll and focus group and not core belief that when i got this thing that took me as one who is a true believeri mean ive been prosecut stab _ day in jail in for what i believ jail twenti other timesat the end of the day peopl have to say i believ in what i do i dont know if there are a lot of peopl in nation polit that have core belief that they would go to jail for or even be will to die for i just dont feel that way about those peopl ultim i onli respect peopl who are will to put it all on the line
ds was there a moment that stick out in your mind dure the campaign with anyon in particular
as not realli
ds what about dure the debat
as you could see peopl chang rememb when i ran in ____ and when the debat start in ____ most of the peopl on the stage includ and edward were prowar i was the first oneeven befor who came out against it then dean came out and join the race later i saw them go from we got to fight terror we got to go to iraq almost to my posit in a matter of four or five month which i consid question it also valid whi you need public pressur i rememb i went to the first huge antiwar march in washington the march i was the first presidenti candid that would go
on barack obama
ds who are you support for presid
as no one yet the question is who is go to support a strong social justic agenda when i sit and look at the democrat debat with all these hangmen noos and all these hate crime and they dont even bring it up how can i support them when theyr not support us if i was on that stage it would be on the agenda
ds the post report back in april that you have a conflict with obama what do you think is behind that stori
as i think it tri to get a doubl shot hurt him with peopl that like me hurt me with peopl that like him say that sharpton has a problem with him so the obama peopl say oh whi is al mess with obama the peopl that are in the debat where he has to contest with oh you have a problem with al sharpton i dont have a problem with obama i talk to obama i talk to hillari i talk to john/ENTITY edward/ENTITY i have a problem that none of them are forc rais the social justic agenda whi that what i do im a social justic leader that what i do and i think if you went to a union leader hed say i like their issu on this but what about labor and i think if you went to a woman leader what about gender divid whi do peopl expect me not to be concern about civil right that what i do
ds whi do you think obama is not domin the black vote
as i dont know i think one they dont know him as well they are just learn him i think hell do alright but i think the strateg mistak his handler madei dont think it was himi they sold him as beyond race the antithesi to the civil right guy the problem with that is the black say okay you arent stand up for us then fine so you cant come back later and say hes the black candid when he said no hes not a ladi at the/ENTITY new/ENTITY york/ENTITY time/ENTITY call to do a stori and i made her chang the whole thing she said i want to do a stori on obama and the civil right generat and the conflict i said youv got a problem obama and i are the same generat we are onli six year apart how do you count generat she said she hadnt thought about that you could do that with jess but obama is __ and im __ that not a differ generat whi dont you talk about that everi generat has had black on the insid and black on the outsid ed/ENTITY brook/ENTITY was in the senat like obama when king was aliv ed brook was elect and sit in the senat when king was aliv and he was a republican from massachusett then we had carol/ENTITY mosleybraun/ENTITY then we had obama ron/ENTITY brown/ENTITY was chairman of the parti when jess jackson was the outsid this new thing is that you guy dont do research there alway been black insid the system and black outsid that not generat that function

ds do you think there should be as i dont know i dont know that debat to me
ds do you consid our militari a volunt armi
as yeah i think that a volunt/ENTITY armi/ENTITY im against draft even when charli/ENTITY rangel/ENTITY came out with it even understand the reason to make rich as well as poor go i just think the rich will find a way to get around it and there will still be a disproportion amount of poor
ds which you saw in vietnam and mani nation leader now found way not to go
as exact right i was in high school at the time of the vietnam/ENTITY war/ENTITY there was a draft and the rich kid didnt go they found a way around it
ds how has the/ENTITY war/ENTITY affect you
as i think it has affect me in that i have seen and actual preach at soldier funer ive seen the famili suffer for absolut no reason there never was weapon/ENTITY of/ENTITY mass/ENTITY destruct/ENTITY there never was emin danger so i have seen it up close and person in term of famili lose their son ive also seen resourc that we could have use to provid train and job in this countri just sent over there arbitrarili i also watch when happen the way peopl who were reloc around the countri couldnt vote at home but iraqi could vote from america in the elect in iraq i think it brought out the glare contradict of american democraci as practic by peopl like the bush administr
ds are you optimist for the futur
as absolut there is no doubt in my mind as i sit here today that the world will be better america will be better and that those like usno matter how controversialwil be redeem in histori there is no doubt in my mind whether we live to see it physic or not i have no doubt in my mind

ds it interest that you have becom that to other peopl
as it is but ill tell you what els is interest that she saidand i dont know if she intend to say it this way or notwhen she said im reverend ___ what a lot of peopl dont understand particular in the white communiti is im project as an ambul chaser but im more the ambul peopl call me becaus they know i will come if noth els you write i have never fought a case where they didnt ask me to come peopl have this pictur like im sit up in bed at night with a walkietalki you hear anyth oh let run it virginia today peopl call us jena all the way to florida all the way to jasper/ENTITY texa/ENTITY all the way to sean/ENTITY bell/ENTITY everi victim call us on my syndic radio show now if we get a case i make the victim get on and say now you ask me to get involv in this that what i did with jena now nobodi rememb becaus nobodi knew what jena was then we respond to a person come in which is whi it absurd when black conserv who put sharpton in charg the victim who put me in charg of jena the peopl involv with jena ask me to come what give you the right to tell peopl not to have who they want to repres them could you imagin im lead the march on ask to come in by the parent of the kid in jail and theyr go to sit on msnbc that night and ask well whi is al sharpton lead it becaus the parent of the kid ask me to lead it duh so at least let be straightup about it
ds do you think the critic is more becaus you are success for bring attent to it
as if i was not abl to bring public attent they would care less and let face it some of them are veri cynic and know they can get a lot of play critic me i was talk about it at the ralli this morningw have ralli here everi saturday you have one guy i cant think of his/ENTITY name/ENTITY a sportswrit from kansa/ENTITY citi/ENTITY who made a career out of critic me about imus he did everi talk show sharpton wrong nobodi ever said wait a minut you a sportswrit what are you speak for what are you talk about it it ludicr i hate to admit it i alway thought i would probabl get kill befor now after i got stab in ____ i was sure that if i got to forti i would never make it to fifti now im fiftythre which is probabl whi i work as hard as i do
ds whi do you think that happen
as becaus they know that there is a market for it they know they can get air time for it
ds did you ever do a test to see if you were relat to strom/ENTITY thurmond/ENTITY as no i just accept the document i never did the dna
ds do you keep in contact with essi/ENTITY mae/ENTITY washingtonwilliam/ENTITY as i onli met her one time becaus again i dont know that we are relat i know that my greatgrandfath was a slave of the thurmond i dont know that there was ani blood when they came and told me i went down to south/ENTITY carolina/ENTITY and visit the cemeteri the cemeteri at the first baptist church of edgefield is all sharptonsof cours the white sharptonsand thurmond while i was there a man came up and said you know the plantat that your greatgrandfath work on is still intact a doctor bought it and he didnt chang anyth he told me if youd like to see it we can go over there it on sharpton road in edgefield sharpton show shankbon the photo of him at the plantat i look at it to remind me of how far weve come sharpton show shankbon photo of civil right leader and his famili this is the last time jame brown was on stage at the to do my fiftieth birthday in ____
ds did you ever think youd reach fifti
as no i hate to admit it i alway thought i would probabl get kill befor now after i got stab in ____ i was sure that if i got to forti i would never make it to fifti now im fiftythre which is probabl whi i work as hard as i do i work __ __ hour day rachel noerdling his assist will tell you __ but shes lie becaus she feel i overwork i feel everi day i live is a day i never expect to live so i tri to do everyth i can i think that part of the problem with a lot of civil right leader is that this is the first generat that actual live to be gray what do gray civil right leader do becaus in the era befor us they were all dead by now
ds who are some upandcom civil right leader under thirti
as some are in my organ youv got tamika mallori who head the decenc initi here in new york youv got mark coleman in you have jerri moffet in i could name you fifteen to twenti in various degre who have a lot of potenti who will becom nation i have no idea i tend to work with all of them we have thirtythre chapter offic in seven citi and __ of them are under forti year old most of the peopl who march with us in jena and washington were under forti year old there a resurg of activ among young peopl and i think a lot of it is they went through this era of black make it as ceo and black make it in manag and now that era is over richard/ENTITY parson/ENTITY is gone soon obama is not domin the black vote so a lot of these peopl are say that it not happen they are go back to that we have to struggl as a unit
ds at thanksgiv my brotherinlaw brother made the point that we in white america dont rememb histori and that when we come across peopl who do rememb histori and we are alway shock whi dont you get over it and move on but that doesnt take into account that there is a long histori of racial problem that have set peopl behind in the race by half a mile and sudden it suppos to be your equal it a fair race now
as get over it yeah peopl are set back half a mile becaus they were given a disadvantag not becaus they fell a half a mile then you tell us to catch up and forget that the race was unfair in the begin your right
ds one see this problem with histori with the christian/ENTITY zionist/ENTITY in the right wing they have an entir differ perspect on histori they dont view thoma/ENTITY jefferson/ENTITY georg/ENTITY washington/ENTITY who were seculara our found father when they talk about america found father they mean cotton/ENTITY mather/ENTITY and the as i think you have to be determin to not allow peopl to dismiss histori you have to use everi forum to put histori into perspect peopl have a reason they want you to forget histori becaus histori doe not back up their point one of the thing martin/ENTITY luther/ENTITY king/ENTITY iii/ENTITY and i talk about is that his father die one of the most controversi figur in the histori of america but you would think now forti year later he was rever by white america he wasnt the new york time would write editori about him tell him to keep his nose out of the vietnam busi who do you think you are when he diedthat when i join the movementw had to fight to get him a nation holiday but today you read stori that guy like us arent dr king well in dr king time they didnt have him as dr king but that the benefit of distort histori if you can eras histori eras whi there are racial gap across the boardhealth care educ incomeif you can eras how that all start then you can make guy like me look extrem but if you look at histori and how we got here were realli veri reason to say some of the thing we have said
ds then the focus is on gangsta cultur and instead of look at how that came about it is talk about as if it is a phenomenon that just happen
as nobodi is look at that and the fact that if you didnt have gangsta cultur wed still be in the back of the bus should we have stronger famili tie of cours should we stress educ of cours should we stress respons of cours but peopl who had selfcontain famili that were veri respons still had to sit in the back of the bus and couldnt check into a hotel let not act like gangsta is what caus racial inequ in our societi it like say youv got cancer but youv also got a head cold so the reason youv got cancer is youv got a head cold no you have cancer and a head cold you take for the head cold but youv still got to deal with the cancer what they are tri to act like is take head cold medicin is go to solv cancer it a bunch of crap if everi black in america had strong famili tie and there were no outofwedlock birth which i strong advoc and preach it still wouldnt solv the racial inequ in the social fabric let be honest about that
black and white and talk about race
ds at the end of the thanksgiv discuss i said that if a black person was sit at the tabl with us we would never have had the entir convers we talk about that do you think there is a nervous amongst the race to engag each other
as a lot of the nervous is that white america is uncomfort with have to deal with the guilt and histori of racism and they certain dont want to admit it is still here and black america in larg part has for so long has had to tri and act like it not there to get along it almost like our silenc will get us access so that we dont offend you and those of us that are offens have to then carri the burden of tri to push the envelop that whi bill tatum who publish the amsterdam/ENTITY news/ENTITY said if we didnt have a guy like al sharpton wed have to invent one becaus everi generat has to have somebodi who push the envelop we just do
ds i think it was lani/ENTITY guinier/ENTITY who use to talk about the problem is the race too afraid to talk to each other about race
as i think lani guinier did talk about that you have to not onli have black but you have to have white and white leadership that want to have that dialogu most of them dont want to have it we have to creat that dialogu and hope some of the thing we are do creat the climat for that dialogu what i have found is that mani peopl in america particular the white peopl dont realli want peac they want quiet just shut up and dont talk about it fine there may be a problem but let not talk about it that not peac that quiet youll never have peac until you have real dialogu and look at the differ between the life of a white and life of a nonwhit in this countri and how we close the gap that how you get peac so peopl dont want racial justic they want racial quiet but racial quiet in the absenc of racial justic is to allow for thing to go forward unfair in the long wrong that lead to explos becaus peopl hold it in as long as they can and then they explod the way to stop the explos is to deal with the problem
ds would you say what sum up the problem with dialogu as you see it is that white peopl are too afraid to offend black peopl by ask question about their percept but that black peopl becom too offend by white peopl ignor
as i think that a fair statement i think that a veri fair statement i wish i had said it that hit it right on the head realli don/ENTITY imus/ENTITY michael/ENTITY richard/ENTITY dog/ENTITY the/ENTITY bounti/ENTITY hunter/ENTITY ds when you think about imus michael richard and duan chapman it start to seem almost like a rehears play they have these racist explos and then they come to you seek absolut how do you feel about play this the critic say whi do they go to al sharpton for absolut what nobodi ever ask is what did sharpton do i made imus go on my radio show and told him he should be fire i never talk to the bounti man abov and i told michael richard im not meet with him sharpton on those seek absolut from him for racist remark
as that a great question becaus if you name don imus richard bounti hunter they all three came and none of them got absolut from me the critic say whi do they go to al sharpton for absolut what nobodi ever ask is what did sharpton do i made imus go on my radio show and told him he should be fire i never talk to the bounti man and i told michael richard im not meet with him so despit what they design to happen with me i never cooper with the design imus onli went on my show think if he did he would get past it i use it for the basi to get him fire he got everyth but absolut whi do they come becaus of my visibl right now nation action network is the onli civil right organ in the countri that can put ten of thousand of peopl in the street i think we prove that if noth els this year from sean bell to jena to washington he thought if he did he would get past it i use it for the basi to get him fire you go where you think if you can get this group not to fight me you get a pass if somebodi is accus of they go to the antidefam/ENTITY leagu/ENTITY doe that make abe/ENTITY foxman/ENTITY the presid of the jew no that what adl doe it insult to us they say al sharpton is not the presid of black america no im like adl is in the jewish communiti that what he doe if anybodi is go to jump on this it him so let me go to him that doesnt mean hes in charg of all black it mean if it a civil right violationthat what they have to dohe been the guy up front it veri simpl in gay communiti you have the human/ENTITY right/ENTITY campaign/ENTITY with women youv got in the jewish communiti youv got adl whi wouldnt you have a nation action network in the black communiti but if saniti is that now can have kim/ENTITY gandi/ENTITY and the jewish communiti can have abe foxman and the gay communiti can have human right group but the black communiti cant have an al sharpton that absurd
ds one of the issu that came up in refer to that at thanksgiv was polit/ENTITY correct/ENTITY my brotherinlaw brought up the don/ENTITY imus/ENTITY nappyhead/ENTITY hos/ENTITY issu/ENTITY and said it was polit correct his brother said that there is a big differ between call black girl play basketbal versus ask a black person whi their famili are in troubl
as big differ big differ
ds but those get equat as be polit incorrect
as i think your right they equat it and it wrong the reason i demand imus be fire was becaus he had a record of make these kind of derogatori statement it clear that nappyhead was a racist term that not question social maladi in the communiti what is the social maladi or irrespons about nappyhead ho is not onli racist it misogynist peopl who tri to put that over as he just wasnt polit correct are ridicul that whi if i or anybodi els said a racist term against anybodi els that not polit incorrect that bias and all of us have made mistak with languag but you pay for it which is whi i dont object to him get a job again but he had to lose that job becaus he had consist violat that job
ds are you okay that don imus is go back on the air
as well well monitor him im not say im go to throw a banquet for him and say welcom home he has the right to make a live but becaus he has such a consist pattern with this we are go to monitor him to make sure he doesnt do it again
ds do you work with the hip hop action network
as on some issu they disagre with me at first when i came out hard on the nword and all but then they moder their view on some thing we work togeth
ds how did they disagre with you
as when i first came out and said the nword the should be stop russel/ENTITY simmon/ENTITY came out and said we cant censor artist then he got such a backlash he said we got it to be mayb voluntari or someth russel kind of slid backward on that one my thing is im against the use of the word and ive been against it for a long time even in my book al on america i wrote a whole chapter on the hip hop generat and how to stop that on top of it all of us have use it ive even stop use it privat becaus it wrong i think the thing that realli drove it home to me was the kid who got beat up in howard beach last year and fat nickth white that beat him up say no nigger in the neighborhoodhi defens in court was that he was use a hip hop term it ridicul absolut ridicul we cant be the onli one in america in which there is no hate term
ds if you could choos how you die how would it be
as i would probabl choos do someth activ i would either be lead a march or preach a sermon i dont want to die old and incapacit id rather die in the fire line
ds what do you think is the greatest threat to human
as our ignor natur our ignor the sign of natur global/ENTITY warm/ENTITY as global warm would be at the top of the list al/ENTITY gore/ENTITY end up be right i think our ignor natur global warm and then our ignor the need for one standard of human right all over the world this second but first natur becaus we wont be here if we dont start take natur serious like global warm and ecolog and whatev we are do with the environ second is how we deal with human right standard all over the world
ds are there ani nation politician you look up to as leader
as i respect denni kucinich i respect keith/ENTITY ellison/ENTITY those are the two that come to mind right away im far more progress than most but i realli respect both of them
