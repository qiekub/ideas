friday may __ ____ craig/ENTITY venter/ENTITY has announc that he has creat the first ever artifici/ENTITY life/ENTITY form/ENTITY on earth at the j/ENTITY craig/ENTITY venter/ENTITY institut/ENTITY a us laboratori and research center
the breakthrough is the culmin of fifteen year of research and build upon earlier work research which saw the creation of a synthet bacteri and the transplant of a genom from one speci of bacteria into a second synthia a nicknam deriv from synthet lifeform combin these two techniqu to creat a new lifeform
a genom was creat use synthet made from bottl of chemic the chromosom sequenc to creat a genom use as a templat an exist bacterium a bacterium from differ speci then had it own genom remov and the synthet one transplant in it place venter achiev is that the new genom switch on and the new cell was abl to replic a process liken to the of a comput with a new oper system
venter achiev has been dismiss by some as fall short of a true technolog breakthrough claim that rather than creat a new genom that he has mere recreat the genom of an exist bacterium a technic tour de forc but not breakthrough scienc accord to caltech geneticist david/ENTITY baltimor/ENTITY amongst the possibl of artifici bacteria talk about are bacteria tailor to solv climat chang by take out of the atmospher and to develop new vaccin more complex organ could includ alga which would both be a sourc of and a co_ remov this is not howev the instant solut to the earth major problem although enough is now known to duplic a genom there is insuffici knowledg as to what the role of individu chromosom within the genom do ani advanc in synthet/ENTITY biolog/ENTITY to design life form would requir a much greater understand of how the creation of are code in a genom chromosom us scientist say he creat first artifici life form octob _ ____
