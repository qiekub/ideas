the hbo film about her life
david shankbon how did you feel about the film
ingrid newkirk laugh ohumi didnt know what it was go to be i had expect becaus i did trust but i realiz there has to be a certain more interest bent to it like my hate mail and my will get nake for time/ENTITY squar/ENTITY tri to draw me out so that i will cri those are the kind of thing i think hbo want to have becaus those are the thing that will hold an audienc better than just the fact so much was left out and i didnt know what was go to be left out so that was interest newkirk and matthew/ENTITY galkin/ENTITY who direct i am an anim the stori of newkirk life
ds you are pretti media savvi was that okay with you that they craft the film the way they did
in you have to make allow becaus you know you will not be direct and produc it yourself so there is some give and take i hope what would be shown is the good of the behindthescen peta and the footag and give a glimps to peopl of whi we do what we do you have to take the bit that you wouldnt necessarili put in your own film
ds mani peopl when they hear about peta think they are an organ that is more concern with the wellb of chicken than they are with the wellb of human how would you respond to that
in that like say to an organ set up to help the homeless is it true you are more concern with the homeless than peopl with mansion yes obvious we are set up to help the nonhuman who dont have anybodi speak for them becaus there are countless organ set up to help human human can often invari help themselv they may have lower/ENTITY wage/ENTITY than they should or be disrespect they may have all sort of but they are not label and doom from the moment they are born to be cut up without anesthesia or use as test/ENTITY tube/ENTITY onc in a while you find the militari use peopl against their will and in the old day orphan were use in experi here in new/ENTITY york/ENTITY but it doesnt happen as a matter of be born get a label as someth you can cut up and depriv of life just for a fleet pleasur
ds jim young one of the lab peopl with the realli red ear
in oh yeah that was great it was fascin someth like a scienc experi like radioact ear
ds everyon was look at them one of the thing he had said was that you want to complet disassoci anim with human
in no i want to more close associ human with the other anim becaus if we took biolog ___ we know we are all anim it just that we decid were god theyr trash that just invalid wrong from everi point of perspect scientif moral and everyth els i want peopl to relat to the other anim it a matter of discrimin and prejudic to make us decid in the past that disabl/ENTITY peopl/ENTITY arent as import as we are or somebodi/ENTITY skin/ENTITY color/ENTITY was differ and we could exploit them now it that we arent the same speci so we can treat them like dirt it not logic that we do that becaus we are all flesh and blood and feel pain suffer joy love and all those thing i think we have to come to term with the fact that we are all in this life on this earth with lot of other differ individu what was that the/ENTITY restaur/ENTITY at/ENTITY the/ENTITY end/ENTITY of/ENTITY the/ENTITY univers/ENTITY dougla/ENTITY adam/ENTITY hitchhik/ENTITY guid/ENTITY to/ENTITY the/ENTITY galaxi/ENTITY in yes we go into space and we look for other speci and we say we come in peac on the side of the space capsulea bunch of hooey if we find them and they are vulner well experi on them well tast them and make thing out of them well haul them back here as trinket and trophi just as we do in where we find bear and monkey we put in the anim we want to use for decor we have to come to grip with the fact that we are behav peculiar toward the other and they are part of life itself with us i dont want to separ them i want to bring us togeth
peta anim right group and the anim liber front
ds how do you feel when you hear other anim right organ come out against peta
in oh i dont mind i think somebodi has to push the envelop if you say someth someon alreadi agre with then what the point so we make some more conserv anim protect organ uncomfort they dont want to be associ with us becaus it will be embarrass for them i understand that our own member write to us sometim and say oh whi did you do this i dont want anybodi to know im a peta member for some of us we agre cordial like that human/ENTITY societi/ENTITY man we exchang email all the time and i nag him that he need to take a stronger posit on some thing and stop mealymouth and he nag me in his email that it about time i condemn suchandsuch it doesnt do ani good for you to stick up for suchandsuch
ds what is someth you have been ask to condemn
in he want us to condemn illeg act ds by the anim/ENTITY liber/ENTITY front/ENTITY in yes those get the anim out of the laboratori and i wont do it becaus if it was my anim i would be happi if it was littl/ENTITY man/ENTITY david shankbon s dog pictur in the lead photo i would be happi
ds so you are okay with alf activ some of that was cover in the film
in it was onli margin cover there was onli so much you could focus on and in such a way there werent rebutt to mani thing which was disturb like when that woman said peta is not do ani good i would love to have seen the whole list of endless victori we have had start with general/ENTITY motor/ENTITY switch to mannequin in crash/ENTITY test/ENTITY in all of it there a huge huge list of everyth
ds how do you feel about the alf
in i wrote a book call free the anim and it about the anim liber front sinc it incept in the unit state not about the alf oversea where it began but it incept here go to about ___someth i talk about how i do support get anim out in the same way i would have support get human/ENTITY slave/ENTITY child/ENTITY labor/ENTITY sex/ENTITY slave/ENTITY the whole lot but i dont support burn i dont support i would rather that these build werent stand so on some level i understand i just dont like the idea of that mayb that is wishywashi of me becaus i dont want those build stand if they are go to hurt anyon and the alf has never hurt ds is arson a lesser of two evil proposit for you then
in yes absolut becaus if the build are stand if the is stand then the amount of pain and sufferingi mean whi would you preserv it just so someon can make a profit by continu to hurt and kill individu who feel everi bit as much as we do
newkirk on human and other anim
ds a critic would say that there is no equat human with anim that by stop research that save live base upon these anim you are valu chicken or mice over peopl
in i think it hokum total hokum first you cant have it both way they are either like us or not like us your use them becaus theyr like us then recogn the way they are like us they are afraid to be in the cage the cage are tini and uncomfort and miser they are frighten they are not treat well in the cours of be experi on it not as if it is just a few of them be use in lifesav experi there are million be use everi year for fool thing includ still experi you know nicotin is bad for you everi littl singl thing is done to them but on the other hand theyr not like us physiolog in mani way that are import which is what make these test invari unscientif you cant extrapol from a mous to a man they have a differ they have a veri differ ds like the experi which were ridicul becaus they show it caus cancer in mice when you inject them with eight time their bodi weight daili with saccharin we arent mice and who consum such amount
in yes peopl are scare and experiment who still use anim are onli a percentag of all the peopl who do research in the us the other research field are more profit in term of applic human/ENTITY clinic/ENTITY work/ENTITY comput/ENTITY map/ENTITY work all those thing where you use human data all those research are do more product work human skin put human/ENTITY dna/ENTITY on the internet this is where the money should be go not do thing you did five hundr year ago by stuf chemic down anim throat or perform some procedur that you later find out doesnt even work on human be
ds do you think block stem cell research is someth that harm anim
in yes absolut if it human/ENTITY stem/ENTITY cell/ENTITY research/ENTITY were in favor of it if you are religi oppos to you do not have to take stem cell from the unabortus you can take stem cell in other way such as from the or a live birth you can do other thing you dont have to violat your religi principl if that the problem
ds in your book make kind choic you have a chapter on bee have you been follow the recent develop on the raptur/ENTITY of/ENTITY the/ENTITY bee/ENTITY in it fascin
ds what do you think is happen with the bee
in they think it a virus or a bacteria dont they
ds that the thing they cant find ani bee bodi million and million have disappear
in it alway fascin how anim go off somewher to die you dont see a lot of dead bird anyway and there are bird in this citi i dont know year and year ago i had not thought at all about bee and i went to a confer in upstat new york and there was a wonder gentl woman name nermin buyukmihci who talk about how violent bee keep is i never thought about or known about this
ds in your book she call them honeysteal
in she talk about the wire brush tear off the wing and the smoke out i thought it was fascin that she could even care about bee i thought to myself well they make this and they make and everyth els for their own nourish and typic we come stomp along and take it all for ourselv give them cheap sugar and them out and kill them i thought that i dont need honey it was just anoth thing where you think whi do i need this
religion and anim the/ENTITY bibl/ENTITY talk about human as custodian of the earth and the religi communiti is begin to awaken to the notion that this mean they need to be involv on environment issu what is the religi communiti relationship to anim welfar
in i think religion has depart so far from it origin that if you look at the root of all the larg religion that you find there is alway an admonish to be kind to anim the chief/ENTITY rabbi/ENTITY of/ENTITY israel/ENTITY say no one should wear fur for exampl there are other rabbi who say you can not keep if you dont keep away from eat meat in christian be awar of the smallest sparrow who will fall you look at the garden/ENTITY of/ENTITY eden/ENTITY and that was a place where the lion lay down with the lamb and there is no slaughter sam brownback rais that exact same quot in my interview with him that god care even when the smallest sparrow fall
in yes i think peopl have depart look at the ten/ENTITY command/ENTITY how mani peopl in organ religion abid by the command they lie cheat and steal covet their neighbor wive the fundament root of religion is to be kind compassion understand to reach out to other religion is often a big busi but there are some peopl like the reverend andrew lindsay in the uk who conduct anim right lectur and there are peopl in this countri who are speak out to say we need to consid the anim but i think it is difficult
ds in the movi they show peta make a chang in tactic from focus on exot anim to focus on livestock such as turkey exot anim are thing most peopl could support but livestock is more out there for mani how would you respond to the argument that progress is increment and by take a leap from focus on exot to focus on livestock you could be overreach
in we work on all of it it wasnt as if we were stop all investig into exot it that we have a string of exposé on these exot anim farm from the peopl who caught these lion cub for photo shoot with kid and take them to auto show and how they are beaten up behind the scene and bulli at one point i thought here we are look into an investig into anoth one of these exot anim place and yet the biggest problem is that not everyon goe to a game farm or a roadsid zoo for a photo shoot with a bear but everybodi eat i thought we realli have to concentr where everyon could do someth becaus three time a day you make that decis
ds a religi argument might be that they were put on earth for man
in you look at the garden/ENTITY of/ENTITY eden/ENTITY and that was a place where the lion lay down with the lamb and there is no slaughter the fall come when somebodi kill and blood is shed and then everyth becom chao and violenc if you look at the true garden of eden what were adam/ENTITY and/ENTITY eve/ENTITY eat fruit berri they werent slaughter the anim but live amongst the anim and everyth was peac so if there a biblic sens i dont think dominionif that the scriptur you are look ati dont think dominion mean exploit it may come with a respons to look after and protect the way the queen had dominion over canada that didnt allow for her to put electrod in it citizen head and test floor polish on canadian it was a protector and isnt that what we are suppos to be protector and not big bulli
fashion and anim
ds did your protest at jeanpaul/ENTITY gaultier/ENTITY have ani effect
in it hard to tell now becaus hes such a bad boy but recent the gaultier compani decid they would meet with us and there is a meet in pari come up short we have been write to him
ds you had mention earlier wool cloth in relat to australian export are you against wool cloth or against how it is made and harvest
in that a great question becaus there are two thing and they realli are in tandem if i onli could have one thing it would be to end suffer if you could take thing from anim and kill anim all day long without caus them suffer then i would take it but i think there anoth question that under that everybodi should be abl to agre that anim should not suffer if you kill them or steal from them by take the fur off their back or take their egg whatev but you shouldnt put them through tortur to do that we should all agre on that sinc we realli dont care at all for suffer but i think there this other question who are we that we have set ourselv up on this pedest and we believ that we have a right take from other everythinginclud their lifesimpli becaus we want to do it shouldnt we stop and think for a second that mayb they are just other like us other nation other individu other cultur just other not subhuman but just differ from be human
newkirk on the worst corpor anim abus
ds when you think of companiesobvi would be one smithfield/ENTITY food/ENTITY ds who are some of the most egregi abus of anim
in it a long list but i would say at the moment it is peopl like jeanpaul/ENTITY gaultier/ENTITY if you are talk about fur if you are talk about wool cloth there is australian wool innov that stick up for all the farmer that export all over the world the major of wool and they are scurril they will not stop live export where thousand upon thousand of these sheep die in appal condit on the way to the middl east they will not stop which is cut the flesh off the backsid of lamb when they are just a few day old without ani we are fight them they need to chang and come into the __st centuri kfc we have been after them for sever year now all we are ask is that they switch to control atmospher kill we know they wont switch to soy chicken overnight although i have given them all kind of soy/ENTITY chicken/ENTITY and said you know broaden your market basel a littl im sure they throw it in the trash which is a shame
ds oh god here come ingrid newkirk with her soy chicken again
in laugh there great stuff there are even soy buffalo/ENTITY wing/ENTITY on the market that are delici
ds what is control atmospher kill control/ENTITY atmospher/ENTITY kill/ENTITY mean they are gass in the box when they arriv at the slaughterhous so that that they are not conscious when they are hung up on the shackl and have their leg broken so that they are not conscious when they go live into the scald tank we have wendystheir egg product is just disgust they have batteri cage for their hen who are just cram in sigh which is the world biggest test lab you see them in the film they are the one shove the monkey into the plexigla tube and the monkey are scream and they are hold their arm behind their back the univers who have grant from the feder govern for anim research for the sheer reason that they want money for their footbal team and money for their presid flower in the offic they will not examin whether or not there are more sophist modern test
anim enterpris terror act
ds tell me how the anim/ENTITY enterpris/ENTITY terror/ENTITY act/ENTITY imped you and what you are do to defeat the act
in sooner or later well have a test case it was design specif to thwart our undercov investig that where it came out of it a slap shoot that has been made into a crimin action it a crimin action now in over a dozen state to videotap or audiotap insid an anim industri which is just extraordinari protect for one particular section of societi pursuit it also make it a feder crime to remov document for exampl even if those document show wrongdo on the part of the busi you cant even xerox them and take them out to give to a report that a feder crime now in over twelv state it all design so that you cant get the good on an industri that is hurt anim in violat of the law and to make that inform public without face a jail sentenc and a hefti fine
ds would you do a target investig in a state where they have that act pass just to test it constitut
in we might well becaus this is suppos to be a free countri there is suppos to be free/ENTITY speech/ENTITY and a public spotlight on what happen in our name with our tax money at least if they are tell consum trust us becaus we are be kind to the anim becaus everyon know now that a larg percentag of consum want to know when they are buy someth how anim are treat if they are string the consum along and give them a fals secur that anim werent harm in the make of whatev it is then i think the public has a right to know exact what is go on in those place that is in the public interest
ingrid newkirk on ingrid newkirk
newkirk talk uncomfort about herself
ds did you and alex/ENTITY pacheco/ENTITY have a fall out
in nowel weve had mani fall out in our year
ds like a famili
in yes yes weve had mani an argument mani a fall out but he separ a long time ago
ds are you still in contact with him
in yes he was in touch with the offic a coupl of week ago i was on the road
ds is he look at becom involv again
in im not sure what he want to do at the moment and im not sure he doe either
ds how would ingrid newkirk twenti year ago look at ingrid newkirk now
in god what a horrid question laugh do you mean twenti year ago becaus weve had the group twentyseven year
ds just twenti year ago the person you were then look at the person you are now
in god less wrinkl i dont know the answer to that i realli dont ds do you think youv achiev a lot of the thing you had want back then
in im never look ahead all i want is to reduc suffer and to get peopl to think of anim in a differ way and that as true then as it is now perhap i wasi dont know if i could say if im less or more optimist i realli cant i think i was just me onli younger
ds do you think other peopl would say that
in i think soi think so i dont know realli
ds do you have ani regret
in profession becaus that what we are talk about
ds or person
in im not go to talk about person
ds just in generalin your life
in these are just terribl question i think you can alway look back and in hindsight know the result of what youv done think mayb i could have been more strateg then or if i had onli knownmayb i could have push harder then but i think in compromis sometim peopl may find it surpris but im so anxious not to lose ground but to gain ground so that we can move ahead that i might take less than if i had known i could have push harder what i could have got
ds see sometim terribl question birth wonder answer
in oh pwah
ds the natur of this interview is on a perman encyclopedia
in ah god help me kill me
ds so the question are design not just around your work but also around who you are as a person
in i dont know in this busi i am veri easi to cubbi hole as someon said to me the other daythey had seen the hbo specialand they said are you realli a sad obsess person and i thought no im not realli a sad person except when i lie awak at night in winter think about all the anim out without shelter and then im sad who wouldnt be wouldnt anybodi be sad if they have a heart it just that ive seen so much in taiwan stand in a slaughterhous for dog you have to get through it and to me have fostercar chicken i know if anyon took a chicken in the way they took a dog in they would come to love that chicken and come to see that chicken had person that chicken would wait for you to come home in the even they cant laugh this off becaus it actual true chicken develop bond with peopl the same way dog do they know youv rescu them if youv rescu them theyll sit on your lap while your watch tv have had those relationship it just as hard for me to stand in a chicken slaughterhous but if anyon had had those experi they would feel the same way i think it hard to pigeonhol me as sad im not im joyous
ds i didnt see you as sad in that movi
in oh realli oh good
ds it interest you brought that up becaus a thought i had watch the film is that peopl alway find someth to critic with a person it not okay ingrid just realli love anim and want to help them but your obsess and sad if you were take a _______ salari everi year and drive around in a merced they would say shes not realli in it for the anim shes complet stuf her pocket with her caus but you are not do that newkirk earn _____ from peta in ____ and the film make that clear so instead the critic is that you are sad and obsess
in right thank you thank you
ds your either milk it for all it is worth
in or you are some weird ascet
ds what do you think drive peopl to jump at negat spin
in it human natur you see the thing at a silli level with celebr they love them and then they tear them down or they are just saliv hope for somebodi to trip and fall i think it jut anoth nasti past of human natur especi if you think somebodi has done someth that make you a littl guilti it veri hard to overcom peopl guilt i know i was the same way when somebodi first suggest to me i should not eat anim i was quit defens about it i rememb that there are mani other thing along the way that i have had to fight out in my own head and get rid of the defens i think peopl are defens and they dont want someon to tell them what to do they know a lot of their life is frivol i had an assist onc who want to leav for the even and i said could you just finish this befor you go home and he said ive got a life and i said yeah me too but mine doesnt consist of play video game for five hour laugh but as you get older i think your perspect might chang and whatev drive you it occur you onli have so much time and you want to accomplish this
ds where do you draw your strength from what behind that question is when i was in law school i did a chihuahua rescu and help to save perhap __ to __ dog i thought it would be a great fulfil thing and it would be easi to do to host these anim while i read my law book instead it was gruel it end up tear me apart
in it doe
ds watch your film i thought i would be a terribl investig i would be like the guy in the movi who simpli couldnt do it i saw a __pound dog that was rape by a man and her insid were torn up i had a dog who almost die on me becaus it had been so sever starv and beaten and the onli thing i could do to get it to surviv was to take a syring full of blend dog food liquid with heavi cream and feed it while it bit my finger it took it toll on me and it was one of the thing that made me veri down on human
in your a good man
ds but it was hurt
in yeah it veri pain
ds where do you draw your strength to continu on and to not hate human
in i definit dont hate human becaus i am one i think were weak i think our speci love to think of itself as all import and know and clever and were not fundament we like a chocol soda and stay in bed late we like some rubbish on tv it just the way we are if everyon could come to america from all over i think they would so they could all get fat and rich and do almost noth and collect unemploy anyway whatev substitut someth there laugh anthropologist have said that it is onli human conceit that has separ us from the other ape for starter the ape realli there is no such thing as a hominid they say there are and were probabl all in it togeth and that we are probabl all the same taxa i see are veri much like human be and they are veri aggress the male will go out togeth and hunt and theyll take apart a colobus/ENTITY monkey/ENTITY just for the fun of it like a gang on the street the male will beat their chest and are full of testosteron and theyll gangbang the femal which happen everi day if you read the newspap and they are lazi if you put them in captiv theyll throw their fece at you but they dont mean it that just their natur it not as if they sat there think this up it their natur
ds anim dont scheme
in no they are just angri upset and agit i think that the same with human be were all a bit like that we have to disciplin ourselv and not go around say how great we are we have to have some disciplin and not be brat and fat littl kid so i dont hate human and i forgot what the first one wasoh how do i get my strength where i get my memori is the next one your go to asklaugh
ds you do have a great memori
in i obvious donta select memori mayb i dont know that it strength so much as i am driven by if i see a cruelti in front of me which i have mani time and i have the power to stop it then someth come from insid me and i will tri to stop it and i will realli mow peopl over to get to an injur anim for exampl or move heaven and earth to get someth fix more than that i have a strong sens of guilt if im not do anyth i dont know how i could forget that the cruelti is there or that the pain is there i dont think i could just decid im go to the beach and im go to live on the beach and be a beach bum for the rest of my life and pretend it doesnt exist and that it not go to haunt me so i probabl do it to eas my own pain in part in know that it exist and tri to do someth you know
ds yes i do know
