sunday august __ ____ univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY tokyo/ENTITY group of research led by bioengin shoji takeuchi has made an electron sensor capabl of smell gase the sensor use genet engin cell sinc previous sensor were not veri accur the scientist decid to tri a biolog approach the invent was reveal in a us scientif journal yesterday and is suppos to be use to design better machin to detect pollut gase in the atmospher
previous smell sensor were base on quartz rod which vibrat when a substanc bind to them the gase are distinguish by their molar mass which can be similar for molecul with differ structur thus relat often trigger a fals posit tri to find a more accur solut takeuchi decid to follow an exampl from insect world as he explain when you think about the mosquito it is abl to find peopl becaus of carbon dioxid from the human so the mosquito has co_ receptor when we can extract dna from the mosquito we can put this dna into the frog egg to detect co_
gene of sever insect the silk/ENTITY moth/ENTITY diamondback/ENTITY moth/ENTITY fruit/ENTITY fli/ENTITY inject into african claw frog xenopus/ENTITY laevi/ENTITY egg allow them to produc relat inexpens and use sensor the choic of the speci was caus by their wide studi and wellunderstood protein express mechan
the modifi cell respond to three kind of and one odour which have similar chemic properti when a molecul of an odor substanc adher to the receptor on the membran protein ion/ENTITY channel/ENTITY open for a certain period of time and a current was generat it magnitud was clear differ for all four test substanc allow to distinguish between them accur
the colleagu embed the sensor into a mannequin so that it could shake it head when a gas was detect it was easier to observ pheromon and molecul with quit similar molecul structur produc clear distinguish reaction with higher accuraci than other biolog or humanmad sensor as the research group said the detect sensit of the odor sensor is sever ten of part per billion ppb and it is as high as the sensit of an exist odor sensor that use an oxid semiconductor the distinct featur of the new sensor is it capabl to select detect some odor substanc rather than it sensit veri few fals posit were possibl due to the biolog mechan involv
at normal temperatur the sensor lifetim is about __ hour which can be extend by put it into a refriger befor first use
shoji takeuchi say has a great hope for research use in futur sinc the frog egg are veri practic for genet engin and can be conveni use to develop smell sensor for a wide rang of gase he said the x laevi oocyt has high versatil for the develop of chemic sensor for various odor we believ that a share abil to smell might open a new relationship between man and robot the research will have wide implic if the sensor is embed in a nurs robot it will be abl to identifi certain mouth odor or bodi odor also it can be use for detect co_ air pollut water pollut and food it veri import for the environ
