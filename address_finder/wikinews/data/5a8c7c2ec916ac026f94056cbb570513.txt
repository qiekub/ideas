wednesday april __ ____ space probe discov that the northern/ENTITY light/ENTITY are seen when electr tornado rotat faster than a million mile an hour hover about _____ mile _____ km abov the earth the energi spin down to the earth where the tornado becom unstabl and interact with the earth/ENTITY magnet/ENTITY field/ENTITY professor karlheinz glassmeier director of the institut for geophys and extraterrestri physic in explain when these space tornado reach the upper atmospher their enorm energi heat the air so strong it start glow that is what generat the aurora aurora near abisko sweden
it is here that all the energi is releas form the aurora what we see as beauti light and color are actual the product of a violent electr/ENTITY storm/ENTITY in/ENTITY space/ENTITY while these electr discharg do not caus ani direct harm to human they can damag manmad structur such as power/ENTITY transform/ENTITY and communic system said andrea keil a physicist at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY california/ENTITY at/ENTITY berkeley/ENTITY view of the aurora australi southern light
time histori of event and macroscal interact dure substorm themi are five probe launch by in februari ____ which orbit earth record the volum and electr current which was higher than ______ scientist had previous conclud that aurora are caus by electr charg particl discharg as solar/ENTITY wind/ENTITY from the sun which interact with the earth magnet field howev these solar discharg strike the earth where the sun is shine and the aurora occur in the opposit hemispher and are visibl in the night sky
this anomali was clear up by themi satellit which show that the earth magnet/ENTITY field/ENTITY held the charg particl befor deflect them from the day side of the planet across to the opposit side of the planet where the particl mass into huge cloud there the accumul charg expand continu until final the cloud becom unstabl releas it energi as a geomagnet tornado which travel down toward the earth along magnet field line becom visibl as aurora in the sky
the scientist present their find at the european/ENTITY geoscienc/ENTITY union/ENTITY egu in just this week nasa launch satellit to studi northern light februari __ ____
