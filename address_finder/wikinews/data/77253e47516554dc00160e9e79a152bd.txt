australian state premier voic dismay
the prime minist john/ENTITY howard/ENTITY has been accus of ad a provis to new law give feder polic the power to shoot to kill the case of a brazilian/ENTITY man/ENTITY mistaken/ENTITY shot/ENTITY dead/ENTITY in london this year is cite by western australia premier geoff/ENTITY gallop/ENTITY as a reason for caution he went on to say the prime minist misl the premier on what law he actual intend to introduc
gallop told when we went to canberra we agre with the prime minist that chang were necessari particular in respect of control order and prevent detent but the shoot/ENTITY to/ENTITY kill/ENTITY polici wasnt part of the agreement and we certain wont be support it in ani legisl in western australia to have a provis like that i think expos us to the sort of risk that we saw in the uk and i dont think this is a good signal to be send out
the queensland premier peter/ENTITY beatti/ENTITY and victorian premier steve/ENTITY brack/ENTITY also rais concern about the shoot to kill provis say it was not in the origin document agre to by the feder and state govern
the new south wale nsw premier morri/ENTITY iemma/ENTITY went further today say he would not put into law the propos law by the feder govern
while confim the state propos antiterror law are suppos to mirror the feder law nsw would not contain a shoottokil provis iemma told the/ENTITY sydney/ENTITY morn/ENTITY herald/ENTITY we will bring forward legisl consist with what was agre to
the feder govern need the cooper of the state as it is constrain in it polic power by the the nsw premier warn that if the feder govern doe not water down it propos law nsw may decid to write differ rule which rais the prospect that feder and state polic will be oper under differ rule in joint antiterrorist oper and have differ legal protect for their action
south australian premier mike/ENTITY rann/ENTITY is still commit to the propos he agre to at last month coag meet in canberra but said they made no refer to power to shoottokil
i will commit right now to everyth that i commit to at coag but i wont commit to thing that i havent seen and i wont commit to thing that have been put in that i didnt agre to mr rann said
australian feder opposit leader join chorus
feder opposit leader kim/ENTITY beazley/ENTITY at a press confer in melbourn said that the state alreadi gave polic power to use dead forc and he want the shoottokil provis to pass through a proper parliamentari inquiri process
there doe not need to be ani addit legisl relat to that what exist now is perfect suffici and it seem to me that what brack and beatti were say mr beazley told the/ENTITY age/ENTITY beazley call for a proper inquiri process in the feder parliament by the parliamentari intellig committe or it senat equival
either way that fine but there need to be an appropri examin of these law by that process befor parliament final deliber on it
law societi concern
jon mcintyr the presid of the nsw/ENTITY law/ENTITY societi/ENTITY said the provis would take away an individu fundament freedom
mr mcintyr told radio that polic would be abl to get an order without a person be reason suspect of commit of an offenc
mcintyr said that intern exampl prove arbitrari power such as these would like be abus
prime minist defend the shoot to kill provis
the prime minist say the propos is noth more than formalis power that alreadi exist under common law introduc by the state
speak on abc/ENTITY radio/ENTITY pm/ENTITY i dont think there a real conflict becaus what were propos is not someth that new there alway been a common law right for polic offic in certain circumst to use dead forc been there for centuri and it been codifi into the law recent becaus there was some doubt about the exact limit of it
he went on to say what we are propos in relat to prevent detent is similar to what now exist in relat to other terror offenc and veri similar to what is in the victorian law
the prime minist is confid that he will work out the differ say ill talk to them im appreci of the cooper that i have receiv from the state premier on this issu
we all know that the sad circumst that now requir unusu law im quit sure that theyr in the nation interest and i am confid they will be approv by the feder parliament and by the state parliament
other concern with the bill
the inclus and definit of sedit which in the bill may includ to bring the sovereign ie the queen into hatr or contempt or to urg disaffect with the australian govern australian law doe not protect freedom/ENTITY of/ENTITY speech/ENTITY so this propos law may effect outlaw critic the australian govern it may also effect outlaw some protest
the abil of judg to make decis outsid of the court system
reckless provid fund to anyon who might be a terrorist is an offenc punish by life imprison even if they are not a terrorist australian terror law face backlash octob __ ____ australian minist leak draft of antiterror bill octob __ ____
