which of your competitor do you expect to pose the biggest challeng to your candidaci whi what make you the most desir of all candid run in the ride
the incumb is the biggest challeng asid from the voter themselv the incumb has the immedi benefit of name recognit and a pretti good track record in offic shes done a pretti good job just for the wrong parti in my opinion the voter are a challeng becaus some of the polici that the green parti are suggest seem strang and radic in some way they are comprehens inclus and holist we dont compartment polici transitclim changehealtheconomi theyr all connect and that what make ani green candid the best option were think of the whole pictur now and tomorrow i understand this citi i understand this provinc i understand the challeng we will face and im prepar to take step now to address them im readi to educ the other politician in queen park and tell them what i think need to be done i also know that there no such thing as a free lunch and were go to have to pay up sooner or later i dont want my daughter to have to pick up the tab
what do you feel are the three most import issu to voter in your ride are these the same top three issu that are most import to you what would you do to address these issu
in london as with most communiti in ontario the three most import issu to voter will be health care health care and health care i agre that health care is import but it cant be address in isol we need to make sure we have enough doctor we must also provid doctor with support from other health care profession we must address qualiti of life issu for health care worker and the populac at larg we must clean up our air water and soil we must produc our food local we must plan our communiti to encourag walk and transit use more exercis mean less obes heart diseas diabet and more transit mean less air pollut and fewer respir ill we must discourag sprawl we must address poverti we must provid shelter to look at ani one issu in isol miss the point our societi is interconnect and our govern polici should be too
the main issu that concern me are sprawl climat chang and peak oil onc again these issu are interconnect they all feed one anoth and we must address all of them togeth better plan communiti mean less commut lower ghg emiss and more time befor we run out of fossil fuel it also mean a healthier communiti and a closer healthier food suppli etc
what should be the first order of busi in the __th legisl assembl
prepar for the come energi crisi conserv must be our watchword
are the properti tax in your ride at a fair level for the amount of servic receiv in the municip
current no becaus exist taxpay must not onli pay for servic but must also subsid new develop expand infrastructur and repair our exist infrastructur in addit to provid a whole host of servic download by the previous govern and not yet upload and sinc properti tax are realli the onli way municip can rais fund they must continu increas to cover cost howev upload servic in some way onli reduc a municip tax to replac it with a provinci one so the taxpay doesnt see it as plain but still pay it we must allow municip to stop subsid new develop and develop new revenu stream ot cover cost while we upload some servic to give them a littl wiggl room municip must be abl to choos their destini
how can the provinc lead the way in stimul job creation
what we do current prop up fail industri is a short term solut invest in sustain industri green power green manufactur manufactur base on renew resourc sustain farm will go much farther so will encourag more local economi our global economi is remark central a part is made here anoth in kentucki and anoth in hokkaido the whole thing is assembl in michigan this mean fewer job but if thing were built local and design local and sold local and repair local and recycl local then we would have a much more vibrant interest sustain and flexibl economi that mean more job
what are your view on the mix member proport represent mmp referendum
ontario must chang the way we vote fptp work when there are two parti we havent had that for a long time what we get now is artifici major where as littl as __ of the vote get a major of the seat mmp is not perfect but it take the best aspect of fptp and pr and combin them into a workabl system that will better serv voter especi voter who arent happi with tradit politick in ontario
what role if ani doe new media play in your campaign and the campaign of your parti websit blog facebook youtub video etc do you view it as benefici or a challeng
i had want to do more but there is so much tradtion polit that new media got sidelin a littl i did get a coupl of video film and they are post the gpo is aggress pursu new media exposur becaus we are be larg ignor by big media local media is do a much better job but big paper and tv have left us out of the discuss it is larg benefici sinc our focus as a parti is on a sustain futur and that appeal to younger demograph who are more like to pay attent to new media it is howev a challeng the internet is a realli big place and you have to be loud funni or interest to be notic hip becom an issu the way charisma did when tv got involv and the well orchestr soundbit can now when an elect i wish it was differ that idea would carri the most weight but idea can be spread by youtub and facebook pretti well
of the decis made by ontario __th legisl assembl which was the most benefici to your this elector district to the provinc as a whole which was least benefici or even harm to your this ride to the provinc as a whole
the best decis was to replac lost fund for health care and educ weve taken step that will help repair these vital social servic more must be done but immedi fund was desper need this help my ride and everi other ride in ontario the worst decis was to not close the coal fire generat plant they are respons for about a quarter of ontario ghg emiss and climat chang is go to cost us a hell of a lot and not just in econom term this cost all ontarian even those not born yet if we had focuss on conserv rather than nuclear would have been abl to get those plant shut down and been well on our way to meet our kyoto target
