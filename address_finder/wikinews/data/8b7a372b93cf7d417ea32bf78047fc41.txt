what do you feel are the three most import issu to voter in your ride are these the same top three issu that are most import to you what would you do to address these issu
healthcar is at the top of the list of provinci and local issu there are still an estim one million ontarian without a doctor and my ride is no except we have also suffer from chronic underfund for healthcar a pc govern would ensur there is catchup fund for durham and other gta___ communiti as well as ani other area of rapid growth this will allow local hospit to continu to provid the outstand care durham resid depend upon

durham ride also face qualiti of life issu that includ gridlock and the need for improv public transit support for agriculturerur communiti and protect of our environ
what should be the first order of busi in the __th legisl assembl
restor trust and confid in govern the past four year have been mar by dozen of broken promis from a govern that promis not to rais tax on the campaign trail and then introduc the __ billionperyear health tax other broken promis rang from tackl gridlock on our highway to close the coalpow generat station
are the properti tax in your ride at a fair level for the amount of servic receiv in the municip
when properti assess rise sudden over a few year it put pressur on retire and person on modest incom who own a hous i fulli support a five per cent cap on the annual assess increas for as long as an individu own his or her home in addit the municip properti assess corpor should be requir to justifi higher assess instead of demand that homeown prove whi their assess is too high
ontario can do better in forg a new partnership between the provinci govern and municip local tax should be use primarili for local need and not to pay for provinci program unfair impos on a communiti there should be longterm multiyear fund arrang for municip a pc govern under john tori is commit to speed up the municip review process so that we can start the reform befor the next provinci budget

what are your view on the mix member proport represent mmp referendum
i am surpris how few peopl are familiar with this import matter it is import that voter learn all they can about the concept and cast an inform vote on octob __ mmp would give seat in the hous to smaller parti that collect a consider number of vote provincewid but never enough vote to win an actual ride and a seat in the hous mmp may help ensur the percentag of popular vote is recogn when issu are brought to the legislatur
the drawback to mmp is that it would make it veri difficult for ani one parti to gain a major it is actual quit rare for parti to get more than __ per cent of the popular vote in addit i have concern that member appoint from a parti list would not be direct account to the communiti in the ride where they got elect the process seem flaw
what role if ani doe new media play in your campaign and the campaign of your parti websit blog facebook youtub video etc do you view it as benefici or a challeng
the new media is play a larger role in the ____ elect campaign especi among younger voter i hope the new media encourag younger peopl to get involv in the polit process my one reserv is that there is not alway the same level of account that is found in the tradit media there tend to be anonym in the new media wherea tradit media is fill with socal gatekeep who are clear identifi and who serv as editor publish report photograph videograph etc there is the potenti for materi to be post onlin that is in error or is deliber fals if this happen it may be difficult to set the record straight
of the decis made by ontario __th legisl assembl which was the most benefici to your elector district to the provinc as a whole which was least benefici or even harm to yourthi ride to the provinc as a whole
i dont feel decis made by ontario __th parliament have benefit our elector district for exampl durham is not receiv it fair share of health fund transport fund and public transit this must chang if durham is to maintain the high standard of live that has been establish through the hard work of mani generat too often fund promis have long implement time limit
