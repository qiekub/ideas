monday novemb __ ____ larg superconduct magnet at the lhc the magnet were made at an american laboratori special in particl physic
the world larg/ENTITY hadron/ENTITY collid/ENTITY acceler it proton to an energi of ___ tev at ____ gmt_ today this set a new world record surpass the ___ tev record set at the fermi/ENTITY nation/ENTITY acceler/ENTITY laboratori/ENTITY tevatron/ENTITY collid/ENTITY which was commiss in in ____ the event came ten day after the lhc collid restart
yesterday at ____ utc one proton beam was acceler to ____ gev ___ tev in lhc three hour later the next record was set by two beam of opposit direct ___ tev each research are delight with the quick progress and are happi with the excel perform of the machin steve myer director of acceler and technolog at the cern particl physic laboratori near comment on lhc optimist compar it with the twentyyear old larg/ENTITY electronpositron/ENTITY collid/ENTITY lep i was here __ year ago when we switch on cern last major particl acceler lep i thought that was a great machin to oper but this is someth els what took us day or week with lep were do in hour with the lhc so far it all augur well for a great research programm
high proton beam energi is need to get mani protonproton collis howev all element of the system need to be monitor care and sudden energi increas are undesir to ensur that the machin oper within normal paramet in order to avoid a repeat of the superconduct/ENTITY magnet/ENTITY quench/ENTITY and consequ sixtonn liquid helium leak catastroph on septemb __ ____ nine day after the first start the damag caus by the leak and the subsequ repair and upgrad to the lhc that were need caus a delay of more than a year in the commiss of the collid
we are still come to term with just how smooth the lhc commiss is go it is fantast howev we are continu to take it stepbystep and there is still a lot to do befor we start physic in ____ said cern director general rolf heuer
