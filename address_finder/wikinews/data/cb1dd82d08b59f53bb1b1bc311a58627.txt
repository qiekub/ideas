wn in chapter __ assault and batteri you recount wit instanc of violenc by david miscavig toward scientolog offici includ ray mithoff mike/ENTITY rinder/ENTITY and jeff hawkin you write i am asham that i did not have enough courag at the time to inform the author or call the polic which would have been the logic thing to do whi do you think you decid not to report these instanc to the polic what do you think law enforc would have done if you had report the matter to polic know what you know now and revisit your memori of these incid in hindsight would you have act differ if you were in the same situat again
as as i mention abov i learn at an earli age that scientolog handl it own and that one of the biggest crime you can commit is to bring about bad public for the organ as that is direct counter to the expans plan of erad the reactiv mind on the entir planet befor it too late at first i justifi the abus make excus for whi it could possibl be occur i thought miscavig is the head of the religion and hes have to handl so much that all the stress and noncompli is put him over the edg but when it kept occur and kept occur i ran out of justif i could final see that it was a pattern of an abus sociopath when i first start expos the abus after i left scientolog sever of the scientolog execut who i use to work with put togeth sworn affidavit claim miscavig never laid a hand on anyon these were type up and sign under the penalti of perjuri they know it a blatant lie but they think theyr defend their religion by do this
regard whether or not i would have done thing differ were i in the same situat today absolutley i would have call the polic i would have file crimin report i would have alert the author that the head of the organ is hurt peopl in mani way and i would have gotten the agreement from my peer that miscavig need to come off ani posit of author and has no right to lead in this fashion i know that i would have been remov for treason and declar a suppress person for make that stand but id be proud of the titl becaus the one thing i would have left intact is my person integr

as the freedom magazin is the public mouthpiec for scientolog often use as a medium to expos what they consid to be the ill of societi psychiatri pharmaceut compani and major critic of their religion i was not surpris that they put out a magazin against those who expos the illeg action of the scientolog leader david miscavig with his repeat abus and assault and batteri be commit on his junior scientolog execut they felt that an attack on miscavig was an attack on the whole religion and therefor those peopl involv need to be expos as rotten to the core
