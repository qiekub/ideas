wednesday decemb _ ____ research say they have scientif proven that stress caus sick the garvan/ENTITY institut/ENTITY has discov that a hormon known as neuropeptid/ENTITY y/ENTITY npi is releas into the bodi dure time of stress their find show the hormon can stop the immun system from function proper
neuropeptid y is one of those hormon that get unregul or releas from neuron when stress situat occurit known for exampl that it regul blood pressur and heart rate so your heart rate goe up but it hasnt been known that it actual can affect immun cell as well said professor herbert herzog one of the research
herzog feel it is good to final have proof of someth peopl have suspect for so long
now we have proven without doubt that there is a direct link and that stress can weaken the immun system and that make you more vulner when you for exampl have a cold or flu and even in the more serious situat such as cancer can be enhanc in these situat said herzog
the garvan institut studi centr on two key event that enabl the human bodi to recognis foreign substanc and control invad when our bodi encount a pathogen bacteria and virus the immun cell retain and interrog suspect their activ is made possibl by npi these cell then return to the lymph node which are found all over the bodi with inform about the foreign invad the lymph node are where decis about defenc are made
most of us expect to come down with a cold or other ill when we are under pressur but until now we have most had circumstanti evid for a link between the brain and the immun system said lead garvan research associ professor fabienn mackay dure period of stress nerv releas a lot of npi and it get into the bloodstream where it direct impact on the cell in the immun system that look out for and destroy pathogen bacteria and virus in the bodi
in the case of bacteria and virus th_ cell are part of the attack team that is sent out on the search and destroy mission but when their job is done they need to be turn off and the immun system reset the same hormon npi that activ the sentri cell now prompt the th_ cell to slow down and die
under normal condit circul immun cell produc small amount of npi which enabl the immun cell on sentri duti and the th_ immun cell to oper it a yin and yang kind of situat but too much npi mean that the th_ attack is prevent despit the foreign invad be identifi and this is what happen dure stress ad mckay
the impact of stress on the bodi has been observ in athlet ph d research at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY queensland/ENTITY luke/ENTITY spenc/ENTITY togeth with the australian/ENTITY institut/ENTITY of/ENTITY sport/ENTITY studi elit and recreat athlet over five month
they found elit athlet were more suscept to respiratori diseas under stress
a lot of elit athlet put themselv through vast amount of physic stress in their train but also their emot psycholog stress of feel the pressur of australia on their shoulder want to compet and want to do their best said spenc
it not just athlet who are prone to stress pressur at work and at home may caus emot and mental stress that can be equal damag almost a third of all work absente in australia is due to ill cost employ over __ billion a year
i think it has a huge impact for the work forc and also for employ if their employe are constant stress constant under pressur they are more like to get sick spenc said
further research could lead to the develop of new drug which may inhibit the action of the neuropeptid y hormon
herzog warn peopl to minimis stress befor it becom a problem
relax method like yoga will help you to prevent that but there will still be peopl out there that are not respond to that and treatment by interf with the system will be import he said there obvious some time until such a treatment will be avail but this is someth we will definit work toward
the garvan research will be publish in the journal/ENTITY of/ENTITY experiment/ENTITY medicin/ENTITY volum ___ no __
