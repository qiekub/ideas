thursday march _ ____ the water was releas from glen canyon dam unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY feder offici flush billion of gallon of water into the grand/ENTITY canyon/ENTITY on wednesday in an experiment effort to distribut sediment throughout the river and restor the ecosystem to a more natur state
the water was releas from two pipe in the glen/ENTITY canyon/ENTITY dam/ENTITY which block the colorado/ENTITY river/ENTITY and creat the artifici reservoir lake/ENTITY powel/ENTITY at a rate of more than ______ gallon of water per second the flood could fill up the ___stori empir/ENTITY state/ENTITY build/ENTITY in __ minut said interior secretari dirk/ENTITY kempthorn/ENTITY this give you a glimps of what natur has been do for million of year cut through and creat this magnific canyon kempthorn said after pull the lever that releas the water the flood will continu for __ hour dure which time the flow of water from the dam is expect to increas by four or five time
after the dam was built in ____ the season flood that would spread sediment throughout the river were halt this sediment was necessari for creat sandbar and beach which serv as wildlif habitat as a result two fish speci have becom extinct and two other have becom endang includ the humpback/ENTITY chub/ENTITY although the water level will onli rise a few feet after the flood offici are hope it will be enough to restor erod sandbar downstream scientist will be conduct studi on how the flood affect the nativ speci and their habitat our ultim purpos is to learn whether or not this is a viabl strategi for creat sandbar and habitat for nativ fish said john hamil chief of the grand canyon monitor and research center our ultim purpos is to learn whether or not this is a viabl strategi for creat sandbar and habitat for nativ fish john hamil
similar experi were conduct in ____ and ____ although randal peterson an environment manag for the bureau of reclam say those condit were mark differ he say that tributari below the dam have releas high volum of sediment in recent year make condit more favor
howev environmentalist from the grand/ENTITY canyon/ENTITY trust/ENTITY which has often critic the govern manag of the dam say there is more that can be done they assert that the flood must occur regular if ani real chang is to be expect and they accus the govern of conduct the experi for show theyr tri to make it appear that theyr do someth benefici when theyr just do it for appear said nikolai lash senior program director for the trust it be manipul to be a one and done even though we know that doesnt work

the best time to get the most money for your hydropow is dure peak energi demand which is general daytim hour and general in the summer martin said the us geolog survey acknowledg that the time was part design in order to maxim electr product dure peak demand
meanwhil other are simpli unhappi with the argu and indecis that have plagu the issu martha hahn scienc center director at the nation park said at some point were go to have to draw a line in the sand and say this is the best way to manag the dam and manag resourc in the grand canyon we cant continu to go on and on just research we have to make a decis we realli are lose valuabl resourc
