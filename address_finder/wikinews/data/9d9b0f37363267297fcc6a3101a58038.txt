thursday novemb _ ____
geologist have confirm that the contin is be torn in two form a new ocean an intern collabor has shown that a __ mile long rift in the region of the desert which open in ____ is like to be the begin of a new sea
the recent studi publish in the journal geophys/ENTITY research/ENTITY letter/ENTITY bring togeth seismic data from the format of the rift show that it is driven by similar process to those at the bottom of ocean
african and arabian tecton/ENTITY plate/ENTITY meet in the desert and have been slowli pull apart for rough __ million year the same movement has also been part the red/ENTITY sea/ENTITY but this is onli at a speed of less than _ inch per year
the sudden crack in ____ refer to by geologist as a megadik intrus open up a rift over __ feet wide in place the studi has found that this happen over onli a few day accord to cindi ebing a coauthor of the studi from the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY rochest/ENTITY we know that seafloor ridg are creat by a similar intrus of magma into a rift but we never knew that a huge length of the ridg could break open at onc like this
the investig was led by professor atalay ayel of addi/ENTITY ababa/ENTITY univers/ENTITY in ethiopia as well as rochest other group involv includ eritrea/ENTITY institut/ENTITY of/ENTITY technolog/ENTITY nation/ENTITY yemen/ENTITY seismolog/ENTITY observatori/ENTITY center/ENTITY univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY leed/ENTITY unit/ENTITY kingdom/ENTITY institut/ENTITY de/ENTITY physiqu/ENTITY du/ENTITY globe/ENTITY de/ENTITY pari/ENTITY columbia/ENTITY univers/ENTITY new york the whole point of this studi is to learn whether what is happen in ethiopia is like what is happen at the bottom of the ocean where it almost imposs for us to go said ebing becaus of the unpreced crossbord collabor behind this research we now know that the answer is yes it is analog
