sunday februari __ ____ molecular structur of dichloroaceticacid
recent test have shown that an inexpens drug may be abl to kill cell in human a drug general use to treat rare metabol disord has shown the potenti to assist in the treatment of brain lung and breast cancer research at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY alberta/ENTITY dr evangelo michelaki of the univers of alberta in edmonton canada found that that dca caus tumor regress in anim with human cancer test show that dca attack cancer cell but did not attack healthi cell
the research and the alberta cancer board and capit health do not advis the use of dca to treat cancer yet as clinic trial for the drug use to treat cancer have not been perform yet structur of a typic anim cell the blue capsulelik structur contain the yellow ribbonlik membran is the mitochondria color are schemat not real
unlik healthi cell cancer cell do not convert food molecul into energi in the instead they reli on a process
known as which take place in the main bodi of the cell while the mitochondria are shut down research believ possibl due to the lack of oxygen suppli to cell in the middl of a tumor
this mean that anoth key function of the mitochondria to activ an abnorm cell selfdestruct mechan is also block
when dichloroacet dca enter a cancer cell it restart the mitochondria which in turn activ apoptosi and the cancer cell destroy itself
dca is known to be relat safe although pain numb and gait disturb may occur the drug is also expect to be cheaper to manufactur than other drug sinc there is no patent for it
