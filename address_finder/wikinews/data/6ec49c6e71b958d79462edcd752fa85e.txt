saturday march __ ____ ice on the fueloil heat exchang of a trent ___ engin dure test as part of the investig
investig with the nation/ENTITY transport/ENTITY safeti/ENTITY board/ENTITY in the unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY have issu an urgent safeti recommend in connect to their role alongsid the unit/ENTITY kingdom/ENTITY air/ENTITY accid/ENTITY investig/ENTITY branch/ENTITY in investig loss of power in engin on boe/ENTITY ___s/ENTITY with the aaib follow suit one of them result in british/ENTITY airway/ENTITY flight/ENTITY __/ENTITY crash short of the runway at heathrow/ENTITY airport/ENTITY last year the ntsb and the aaib want rollsroyc to redesign the engin
both event occur on boe ______er airplan power by rollsroyc/ENTITY rb___/ENTITY trent/ENTITY ___/ENTITY seri/ENTITY engin on januari __ ____ british airway flight __ experienc a dual engin rollback reduct of engin power on final approach to heathrow and crash leav one passeng serious injur eight passeng and four of the flight crew with minor injuri and the airplan written off
the second event occur on novemb __ ____ when a delta/ENTITY air/ENTITY line/ENTITY boe ___ experienc a singl engin rollback dure cruis flight over unit state while en rout from normal oper resum after the flight crew follow boe publish procedur to recov engin perform and the airplan land safe in atlanta has alreadi develop new procedur after the crash to prevent ice from build up within their ___ fuel system after it becam appar that ice may have been a factor and it was some of these that the delta flight crew had follow boe modifi these further after the delta incid as part of the recent releas by the ntsb and aaib it has becom appar that investig from both bodi which are collabor have found ice buildup in the fuel system caus both rollback
in both case a buildup of ice from water normal present in all jet fuel develop on a compon call the fueloil heat exchang this restrict the flow of fuel to the engin result in the uncommand engin rollback investig initi struggl to produc enough ice under test condit but have now found that at high concentr fuel can form ice at veri low temperatur in enough quantiti to serious restrict fuel flow accord to a new interim report by the aaib this doe not occur when fuel demand is lower as the hot oil then becom suffici to entir melt the ice the british jet experienc veri low temperatur over the wreckag of the british airway jetlin
the vigor test are thought to be the first of their kind they have also confirm that while ice may have form elsewher in the airlin fuel system fuel was probabl not restrict at ani other locat instead it is thought soft ice form in the pipe and then broke off travel to the fueloil heat exchang and restrict it
the ntsb has now reveal that they have advis rollsroyc to redesign the fueloil heat exchang and rollsroyc have state that they are inde work on a replac part that will be avail within twelv month the aaib advis boe and rollsroyc to joint review the problem across the fuel system and both compani respond that they accept this recommend and repeat that a replac part was be develop
both the ntsb and the aaib also sent letter to the us feder/ENTITY aviat/ENTITY administr/ENTITY and the european/ENTITY aviat/ENTITY safeti/ENTITY agenc/ENTITY request the instal of the modifi compon be mandatori the ntsb suggest this should be either the next mainten check or within six month there are ___ boe ______s the onli type use the affect engin with trent ___ seri engin
the fueloil heat exchang is a dual purpos part design to simultan melt fuel ice and cool down engin oil
the aaib further note that it is unclear weather other aircraft design are at risk and advis the faa and easa to look into increas use of deic addit and investig both the accumul and sudden movement of ice in aircraft fuel system and the actual format of ice in the fuel itself interim report blame ice for british airway ___ crash in london septemb _ ____ us uk investig collabor after us ___ incid similar to london crash decemb __ ____
