andrea hornig wikinew contributor and team member of synergi moon competitor in the googl/ENTITY lunar/ENTITY x/ENTITY prize/ENTITY manag to interview senior director of space prize william pomerantz of the x/ENTITY prize/ENTITY foundat/ENTITY about the competit goal and impact via email for hdtvtotalcom and wikinew
andrea hornig pleas introduc yourself and the googl lunar xprize glxp
william pomerantz my name is william pomerantz and i am the senior director of space prize at the x prize foundat in that capac i manag all of our space activ here at the x prize includ most notabl the googl lunar x prize
the googl lunar x prize is an unpreced intern competit that is challeng and inspir engin and entrepreneur from around the world to develop lowcost method of robot space/ENTITY explor/ENTITY by reignit a race to the moon we are engag a new generat make lunar explor not just a histor accomplish but a tangibl and ongo realiti the googl lunar x prize is a competit that will award us__ million for the first privat fund team to send a robot to the moon the robot is requir explor the moon by travel ___ meter along abov or below the lunar surfac and by transmit high definit video and high resolut photo back to earth ah whi is googl an internet servic provid interest in philanthrop and scientif field
wp googl believ that by set an ambiti goal like land on the surfac of the moon and by offer an incent prize is a good way to both inspir the world and to incentiv the develop of technolog and system that will both allow us to explor the univers and in so do improv the state of human in the world as larri/ENTITY page/ENTITY said when we announc the googl lunar x prize scienc has a serious market problem and i think this is the best antidot ive seen for that
a few choic word from sergey/ENTITY brin/ENTITY also help explain googl role in this endeavour were proud to sponsor the googl lunar x prize googl is sponsor this prize becaus it is realli differ than ani other kind of corpor sponsorship that ive seen it realli go to accomplish someth veri veri impress we hope to have help make privat space flight more viabl effort like this will stimul a passion for spacerel research and educ in a new generat of potenti innov one of the thing that realli exit me about this project is how it can help with educ i mean space realli fascin colleg student and i think this will inspir a lot of interest in space in the physic that surround it the math and the histori of the space program i think all the interest and attent on this prize is go to be veri benefici to the educ of our children were hope that our sponsorship of the lunar x prize will help spark a new generat interest in the field of math scienc and comput scienc which should ultim prove quit benefici to both the intern workforc in general and googl in particular wp
ah one of the task the glxpteam have to do is to captur and stream video in qualiti from moon back to earth whi is this import
wp an import aspect of moon __the new era of lunar explorationi how participatori it is regardless of who win the googl lunar x prize million upon million of peopl all around the world will be abl to experi the mission through these video stream that huge import as we look to capit on the excit inher in those voyag to get peopl of all background more excit about scienc technolog engin and mathemat
ah what condit do these video have to meet bandwidth in space is still crucial and expens so high framer and datar will be difficult to broadcast as a live stream and video with almost in stillmod arent interest for audienc so what wonder dynam sequenc can we expect and what cameraman and editor dream do you want to see come true like colordepth contrast final see star on moon imag not outshin by moon surfac or even audiovideo codec
wp weve impos a few minimum qualiti guidelin upon our team but the major of these decis will be left them we want to give them the freedom to select both the shot and the technolog that best fit their missionth design of their spacecraft or spacecraft the land site they chose the manner in which they move along or abov the lunar surfac et etcetera
ah what will happen to the video and the collect data is there a plan to publish the video on and to integr the photo in is this the logic expans of to bring peopl to place where realli most of us wont never ever put a step
wp the video and other footag will be major promot around the world we expect that this will be a massiv global stori that appeal to a huge varieti of audienc and well work with our partner to provid as mani way as possibl for fan and for student to follow along
ah a nice littl sideeffect will be if one team will accomplish the secondari point to rover to one of the mission land site and captur imag of the remain relic wouldnt it be help to prove a lot of moon/ENTITY land/ENTITY conspiraci/ENTITY theori/ENTITY wrong by find and show these relic this will definit influenc the search rate of this topic on googl
and how do you achiev conserv of these almost sacr monument of human accomplish and not contamin it with new track of land and rover gear
wp the googl lunar x prize includ a bonus prize for revisit the site of previous mission to the mooninclud not onli the apollo site but a varieti of other robot probe land or impact site this is import not just for the reason you mention but also carri a huge amount of scientif signific as well this is the reason whi itself has alreadi conduct one such mission when the apollo/ENTITY __/ENTITY crew visit one of the surveyor/ENTITY lander/ENTITY our team all understand that ani such visit need to be done respect though thank no one can appreci the histor signific of the vehicl current on the lunar surfac more thorough than those peopl all around the world current work on new lunar mission each of them will have enorm emot incent to ensur that whatev they do they do respectfullyand with team reli larg on donor corpor sponsor and similar who are back their mission to earn good will they will have financi incent as well
ah although spaceexplor has ever been an object of nation prestig the import of intern and multilater connect are so intens that almost ani big space project and mission is the result of close collabor the intern/ENTITY space/ENTITY station/ENTITY iss is on a global scale the arian/ENTITY _/ENTITY launcher on a european scale and even the member of glxpteam are work togeth across border is it possibl to connect the collect data with other alreadi collect data like the japanes that kaguya name orbit also had a on board and took video from lunar orbit or futur mission like european long term mission plan aurora/ENTITY programm/ENTITY and indian and chines mission plane to go to the moon although the team are privat fund the scientif data should be use for the benefit of everybodi and that it could be valid by the scientif communiti
wp the mission of the googl lunar x prize team are inde sure to add to the bodi of data use by profession and amateur scientist and engin all around the world
ah the review/ENTITY of/ENTITY unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY human/ENTITY space/ENTITY flight/ENTITY plan/ENTITY committe/ENTITY augustin commiss last year and us presid speech in februari chang the goal of the us space program especi presid obama announc that the emphasi of privat contractor should be strengthen to reduc public money in nasa and other relat project on the one side but also to encourag privat enterpris to fill in the gap like privat compani servic the iss with falcon launcher in this high disput way nasa should play the role of the arrowhead to do the highlevel explor and leav ground for privat busi in lowlevel
way back befor this was announc the glxp was start did you forese this and what could be glxps part in this new orient
wp it difficult to say where exact the final decis will end up regard the futur of nasa explor program but one this is alreadi clear peopl on both side of the debat are realiz that if appropri plan out civil space agenc can great benefit from space explor capabl develop by privat firm to reach the ideal most effici situat it import to ensur that the capabl be develop by these commerci firm are complementari to rather than competit with what nasa and it counterpart in other nation are develop thank this is exact the case and inde we had veteran of both nasa and involv in help us draft the rule for the googl lunar x prize in the end the googl lunar x prize team will be develop a larg number of system and technolog that nasa esa and other agenc can use to accomplish more of the amaz thing those agenc do for less money
ah are there special point a team can get for captur video in stereoscop/ENTITY _d/ENTITY mar/ENTITY rover/ENTITY had _dcamera on board and even director is invest privat money to help nasa mar scienc laboratori mission to get a previous dump _dcamera on board the curios/ENTITY rover/ENTITY on the one hand side it is scientif worth to have this for optic measur and on the other it will provid a more realist view to the audienc and of cours youtub offer a beta status featur to present it in adequ way with current stereoscop videoplay you still have time to complet it
wp team will like see some import financi incent for captur video in _d but the googl lunar x prize itself doe not explicit reward this recal though that the googl lunar x prize should be just the first step of a long and lucrat busi plan for our compet team
ah what will you do for the first success mission is there mediacoverag plan from feed to livestream and of cours video on youtub and possibl documentari distribut besid do a celebr parti on googleplex
for the first moon land the video is one of the most signific histor record and was broadcast all over the world even with low resolut noisi qualiti and in blackwhit and some of this data was almost lost and poor archiv so that it had to be restor befor be releas in ___p for the __th anniversari how will you handl these priceless record
wp we definit plan on a huge realtim onlin presenc coincid with ani googl lunar x prize attempt social media will play a key role ah im a mar enthusiast so what will come after the success glxp mission will there be a googl mar xprize eventu or will there be a logic next step like a glxp with sampl return requir the xprize foundat announc new categori and more competit everi year what can we expect
wp we are current consid a wide rang of potenti futur space x prize were look at a broad rang of technolog and mission includ everyth from orbit/ENTITY debri/ENTITY clean up to radic more effici launch technolog
ah in close do you have a question request or wish for our reader
