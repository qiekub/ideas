on the earli day
wikinew desit the fact that you focus on a lifestyl set in histor time your band name mean steelreinforc concret whi did you choos that name
jarkko we got togeth and had a littl convers about the name of our band pretti soon v rantanen suggest the name teräsbetoni we all thought it sound great and it describ our music well in a way that made peopl think what the hell is this and here you have to understand that word teräsbetoni sound and is much cooler than steelreinforc concret i guess the name was okay caus we didnt have a tendenc or need to write song about histor time those kind of song just came out there are also song that arent set in the past more into this day or this moment
wikinew how did you come up with the concept for the band
jarkko most it just happen we all must have had some kind of vision about the music and the look for sure and we all agre about the leather and skin that how it all began we wrote song we thought were good and metallish we play them as metal should be play loudnproud there must have been someth special about our music and live perform caus the fan crowd just kept grow and grow and while the band evolv the concept evolv on it own
wikinew which artist would you say inspir you
jarkko we all have our inspir i cant tell who have inspir other band member but ive alway been inspir by the hard rock band of the seventi deep/ENTITY purpl/ENTITY uriah/ENTITY heep/ENTITY black/ENTITY sabbath/ENTITY you know all the __s classic from the eighti band like have been on my cd player nowaday im inspir just by good music no matter what kind of music it is if it sound great
wikinew did the earli reaction on the internet surpris you
jarkko it sure did we knew we had someth special on our hand but there alway someth special somewher all the time you know we had this notsoprolook site with a pictur of us and three demo songsand that was enough all the basic piec were so fit that noth els was need and of cours there was also this are these guy seriousth go on it still is
wikinew when you made your debut releas you becam an instant hit in finland what was that like for you at the time and how is it now still be a big success there
jarkko well you alway tend to think that when you hit big your life chang and everyth is cool and crazi but to us it realli didnt chang after our first hit song taiva lyö tulta reign the air we were still play in the small club with low price i guess mani facet believ that we were just a fuck joke it took some time for the gig organ to realiz that peopl want to see and hear us live anyway it was all clear when we visit summer festiv and got huge audienc sinc then it has been pretti steadi
now with all this eurovis stuff and public it much more bigger than it was with our first hit and first album of cours we arent newbi to success and public now so we take it causual none of us realli love be some kind of small celeb but what we like is play our music to our fan that never seem to let us down it great to meet them after gig and have few beer so if public is requir for that well accept it happili
wikinew some peopl have describ your music as corni or camp how do you respond to that would you agre with the view by some peopl that much of what you do is in fact a parodi
jarkko let put it this way if we would sing in english that kind of think would be much less common the problem seem to be the fact that most of the peopl actual seem to understand our lyric and they think that we cant be serious with this stuff hell thousand of band do the same thing in other languag and nobodi laugh of cours we have fun when play live or give interview but when we write new song and record them it all real and true
on eurovis
wikinew what doe it feel like to be select to go to eurovis especi consid it is most an english/ENTITY languag/ENTITY contest is that daunt at all
jarkko daunt no way im proud of be the repres of finland finland has never done too well in eurovis song contest but lordi gave the whole show a nice slap in the face you know it doesnt have to be pop to win the number one slot you can actual play rock music there we might seem a bit odd to european viewer caus we have our leatherish look metallish music and we sing in finnish but in the end i wish that peopl will like it
wikinew what is the song about
jarkko the song is set in the teräsbetoniworld with certain lyric style so there are hors hero and battlefield but in the end the song is about harsh of life the call of duti and responsibilti
wikinew how do you expect europ to react to a metal song in finnish
jarkko well you can onli guess i believ they react like finnish peopl do they hate it or love it hope most of them will love it
wikinew of cours finland has a histori of similar eurovis entri were second choic to repres finland onc with and of cours lordi won the whole contest in ____ what do you think of those entri
jarkko both of the band have strong imag and style im not too fond of their music but you cant realli deni their achiev
wikinew of the entri so far exclud yourself who to win
jarkko i havent heard ani other entri yet well check them out when we go to serbia caus well be there for two week that enough of full time eurovis song focus
wikinew do you reckon you have a chanc of victori yourself
jarkko youll have to believ in your self if you go to a fight this is also one of the theme of our escsong missä miehet ratsastaa
wikinew a video for the eurovis campaign plan to be shown to the press was deem too bur for the contest was that anoy
jarkko you mean our music video i think the first version of the video was a bit heavi stuff for the peopl who dont us but the new version doesnt realli differ too much from the origin so in that perspect it was a bit annoy or mayb better word is pointless
wikinew mani peopl read this will be think about who to vote for at the contest whi should they vote for you
jarkko becaus what we do is true and pure we come as we are and play from our heart
that seem to be pretti rare in nowaday music especi in pop genr where glamour and glitter seem to be essenti and our song is good too
the new album
wikinew how has the reaction to your latest album been
jarkko well it reach the posit number _ in finland album chart most of our fan have thank us for the best album so far ive seen few review and they werent too flatter on the other hand theyv never been caus most of the review tend to discuss our look imag and the lyric but it all right that kind of critic have never affect to our listen
wikinew what sort of thing are the song on this album about
jarkko we are still fight for metal music so there are tradit song about play this music and call all our brother and sister to get togeth the other subject vari from nightmar to galley slaveri from possess to burden of believ in your caus etc
wikinew talk us through the write process for the album
jarkko this time we had much more time to write new song than we did with our second album vaadimm metallia on the other hand the record process schedul was more shatter than it was with vm
the cycl of write must be a bit differ with each writer but for exampl i might come up with an idea of a titl of the song or just a guitar riff from there i start to develop the song most it come out pretti easi sometim there just a special mood that evolv to a song when the rough version of song is in my mind i record a demo of it while record i start hear how the song should be sang and play i also arrang the song in the demo phase i make the demo readi polish and send them to band member ar and produc i believ a järvinen and v rantanen song writer as well work pretti much the same way
at this point we give each other comment and critcism about the song weve written with the help of the produc and a r we choos the song that should be record on the album of cours the whole process is more complex but basic the it goe like that
wikinew did all the record product etc go smooth
jarkko yeah it did hiili/ENTITY hiilesmaa/ENTITY our produc and the band knew each other alreadi and we had discuss about the sound and direct of the new album the work habit were familiar to us from the vaadimm metalliasess so from that point of view thing went smooth our guitarist actual did some solo and back vocal at home i think that a great exampl of relax way of produc
wikinew do you plan a tour this year to support the album
jarkko were alreadi gig around finland and summer tour is in the make visit countri abroad would be great too
northern king
wikinew how did you come to be involv with northern king
jarkko the whole thing began with raskasta joulua tour that i was in we also did an album call raskaampaa joulua anyway there was some talk about do someth els togeth you know not just christma carrol in metal mode nobodi realli had the time to start write new song so a cover album seem to be a nice way of proceed
everybodi agre that the album should sound massiv and orchestr at first we had no other direct than cover the music we like i did a demo of procol/ENTITY harum/ENTITY salti/ENTITY dog/ENTITY with erkka korhonen it was a good exampl of what we should sound like but our record label a r osku ketola thought that we should do someth more defin after few thought we decid to concentr on pop hit of the __s that how it all began i had a chanc to arrang my own atc which was lot of fun
wikinew what it like work with the other three establish rocker
jarkko unfortun we didnt see each other while make the record that may sound crazi but that how it goe nowaday it so easi to record your part and send them to the studio for mix happili we saw each other while the photo video shoot marco hietala toni kakko and jp leppäluoto are all great musician and great person if we ever get to do ani show togeth im sure it would be wonder in music and in brotherhood
wikinew is it hard to divid your time between the project
jarkko it all depend on what you have go on alreadi while make northern king album teräsbetoni was have a break i tri to do thing smooth and avoid book too much stuff on my calendar you shouldnt be too greedi and accept all the stuff offer
of cours there are except for exampl while we were record myrskyntuoja i had to leav studio earli or not go there at all caus of promot action agre by our record label i can understand the mean of promot but noth suck more than bother an intens studio session with anoth project it screw up your focus but fortun that kind of shit is rare enough so i dont care complain about it and the bottom line is that project like northern king bring great varieti to your life as an artist
wikinew is coordin thing with the other member hard when theyv all got their project too
jarkko well luckili i didnt have to do that that produc and ar busi but what ive seen from asid it doe seem a bit hard to fix up meet promo session etc somebodi is alway go somewher
wikinew what do you think person of the cover youv produc
jarkko im veri satisfi with the result we all got to do arrang and song that look like us ive heard few cover album and theyv rare been interest i think we manag to reach that point
wikinew what about the work of the other in their band do you like their music as well
jarkko i give all the guy my sincer respect for their work i think marco hietala is one of the finnish heavi metal legend and it still rock im not so much into nightwish anyway there someth that doesnt quit pleas my ear mayb i should listen to it more charon is good on it field and so is sonata arctica while it style is not the style i prefer to listen in metal music
the futur and final word
wikinew except for an apear at wacken/ENTITY open/ENTITY air/ENTITY you havent done much intern stuff prior to now might we see some gig abroad in ____ and if not when
jarkko all i can say is i wish there might be few gig in the summer but well see
wikinew you said missä miehet ratsastaa wouldnt be translat into english simpli becaus it was design to work in finnish doe that mean we could see some song written special in english in the futur
jarkko with teräsbetoni i doubt it we are pretti much focus on our own languag it would be pretti hard to see us sing in english and still be teräsbetoni you know
wikinew what do you expect eurovis to do for you have you seen ani chang alreadi
jarkko i hope we can get our music out as wide as possibl even though it just one song i believ that it evok interest in watcher and listen the local media has been interest in us sinc we won the final but noth special hasnt yet happen
wikinew load of peopl in the music industri have been complain that download illegali is kill the industri do you agre
jarkko i believ it affect the industri and it sale still it hard to believ that it kill the industri of cours i also have right that the illeg download violat so even though it not kill the industri it total wrong the whole system has to chang somehow that for sure
