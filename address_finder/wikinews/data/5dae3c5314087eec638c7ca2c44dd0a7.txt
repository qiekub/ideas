tuesday septemb _ ____ formica fusca from file
nick bos of the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY helsinki/ENTITY studi the amaz adapt social insect have evolv in order to fight the extrem parasit pressur they experi in a recentlyaccept paper bos and colleagu describ ant appear to selfmed
the team use formica/ENTITY fusca/ENTITY speci that can form thousandstrong coloni this common black ant eat other insect and also aphid/ENTITY honeydew/ENTITY it often nest in tree stump or under rock and forag worker can sometim be spot climb tree
some ant were infect with beauveria/ENTITY bassiana/ENTITY infect ant chose food lace with toxic hydrogen/ENTITY peroxid/ENTITY wherea healthi ant avoid it hydrogen peroxid reduc infect ant fatal by __ and the ant vari their intak depend upon how high the peroxid concentr was
in the wild formica fusca can encount similar chemic in aphid and dead ant the/ENTITY independ/ENTITY report selfmed ant a first among insect
bos obtain his doctor from the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY copenhagen/ENTITY he began postdoctor research at helsinki in ____ he also run the antysci blog the blog aim to help address a gap between scientist and the general public the name is a pun referenc ant it primari topic scienc and nonscientif jargonfre communic he now discuss his work with wikinew wikinew what first attract you to research ant
nick bos me and a studym were keep a lot of anim dure our studi from beetl to butterfli and to ant we had the ant in an observ nest and i could just look at them for hour watch them go about this was in my third year of biolog studi i think after a while i need to start think about an internship for my msc studi and decid to write a coupl of professor i end up go to the centr for social evolut at the univers of copenhagen where i did a project on learn in ant under supervis of prof patrizia dettorr i like it so much there i end up do a phd and ive been work on social insect ever sinc
wikinew what method and equip were use for this investig
nb this is a fun one i tri to work on a veri low budget and like to build most of the experiment setup myself we actual have equip in the lab nicknam the nickin inick and the nicktendo__ there not that much money in fundament scienc at the moment so i tri to cut the cost wherev possibl we collect wild coloni of formica fusca by search through old treetrunk in old log site in southern finland we then hous the ant in nest i made use ytong aerat/ENTITY concret/ENTITY it veri soft stone that you can easili carv we carv out littl squar for the ant to live in cover with old cd cover to prevent them escap we then drill a tunnel to a pot the forag arena where the ant got the choic between the food with medicin and the food without
we infect the ant by prepar a solut of the fungus beauveria bassiana afterward each ant was dip in the solut for a coupl of second dri on a cloth and put in the nest after expos the ant to the fungus we took pictur of each forag arena three time per day and count how mani ant were present on each foodsourc exampl of aerat concret which provid a home for the subject
this gave us the data that ant choos more medicin after they have been infect
the result that healthi ant die sooner when ingest ros reactiv/ENTITY oxygen/ENTITY speci/ENTITY the group of chemic that includ hydrogen peroxid but infect ant die less was obtain in anoth way as you have to forc feed the ros as healthi ant when given the choic ignor that foodsourc
for this we basic put coloni on a diet of either food with medicin or without for a while and afterward either infect them or not then for about two week we count everi day how mani ant die this give us the data to do a socal surviv analysi
we measur the rosconcentr in the bodi of ant after they ingest the food with the medicin use a by ad certain chemic the ros can be measur use the emiss of light of a certain wavelength
the detriment effect of ros on spore was easi to measur we mix differ concentr of ros with the spore plate them out on with an where fungus can grow on a day after we count how mani spore were still aliv
wikinew how do you consid your result to be
nb the result we got are veri reliabl we had a lot of coloni contain a lot of ant and wherev possibl we conduct the experi blind this mean the experiment doesnt know which ant belong to which treatment so it imposs to influenc the result with observ/ENTITY bias/ENTITY howev of cours this is proof in just one speci it is hard to extrapol to other ant as differ speci lead veri differ live
wikinew where did the ant and fungus you use come from how common are they in the wild
nb for ant see abov about the collect
this speci of fungus doe appear in finland but we chose to use a differ strain from with thank to prof j eilenberg and the laboratori technician louis lee munch larsen from the univers of copenhagen anim can adapt to local strain local adapt and just to make sure we thought it would be good to use a strain of fungus that the ant definit did not evolv specif resist against this mean that the reaction of the ant to selfmed is veri like to be a general respons and not just against their local fungal enemi the univeristi of helsinki from file
wikinew are there ani ethic consider around expos ant to toxin and parasit
nb legal no insect do not have ani right as such regard ethic that said we do take measur to not make them suffer unnecessarili for exampl dissect are done when the ant are anesthet either by co_ or ice and when ant need to be kill we do it in alcohol which kill the ant in a matter of second so while the ant do not have right as such we still tri to handl them with as much respect as possibl even though the experi involv infect them with a dead fungus
but even though the _____ ant in our studi sound like a lot and it is this is neglig in the grand scheme of thing it has been calcul that in the/ENTITY netherland/ENTITY alon near a trillion insect die against just the licencepl of car everi six month i dont own a car so that mean im excus right
wikinew this is the first evid for selfmed insect how widespread do you think this phenomenon could be in realiti
nb it not actual the first evid for selfmed in insect moth and fruit fli definit do it and there evid in honey bee and bumblebe as well so it seem to be quit widespread in the insect world i have no doubt that as time goe on there will be more and more case document insect and anim in general seem to be quit good at take care of themselv
wikinew how might ant locat heal substanc in the wild
nb veri good question this is someth that import to know if they would onli do it in the lab the behaviour wouldnt be veri interest we have some guess where they might get it from but at the moment we dont know yet that said i plan to investig this question among other further in the next coupl of year anoth file photo of formica fusca this time show forag worker feed
wikinew for your phd you research ant scentbas communic could healthi ant perhap tell other ant are infect and encourag this behaviour
nb there not much known about this there conflict evid about whether sick ant actual smell differ from healthi one or not at the moment it seem that sick ant most take care of the problem themselv sick ant stop most interact with nestmat and especi and leav the nest to die in isol this is probabl for reduc chanc of infect nestmat but of cours it also reduc the work load of their nestmat as their corps doesnt have to be drag out etc
so as an answer to the question i would find it unlik that such a behaviour would evolv but it not known yet
wikinew ant general avoid the peroxid if they were healthi but in some circumst might they tri to build resist against infect in advanc
nb who know also not known yet unfortun that said there is a veri interest studi about resin collect in ant wood/ENTITY ant/ENTITY collect treeresin which has antimicrobi properti they collect this even if not infect and when you infect them they dont collect more of the resin than normal so basic it seem like they collect it in order to keep diseas out of the nest so they stop the diseas befor it can actual infect them
wikinew are there plan to follow this research up might you research other speci other substanc
nb i first want to find out where they get it from in natur there might be mani sourc of medicin recent evid suggest that tobacco play a similar role for bumbl bee dalial freitak who is also on this paper is current run test with phd student siiri fuch who is also on the paper with other substanc to see if ani have the same effect as h_o_ hydrogen peroxid
onc the behaviour has been well describ in this speci of ant i might do a comparison with other speci for exampl onc we find the sourc of the medicin in natur would speci without access to this sourc also have evolv the same behaviour in the lab and if so where would they get it from
also can ant medic their friend
wikinew what other research are you work on right now
nb phewlot
i still have some question left unansw from my phd work relat to how ant recogn who is a friend and who isnt i also start collabor with prof michael poulsen from the univers of copenhagen on immun in fungusgrow termit as well as their chemic recognit abil furthermor were work on social parasit in woodant ant have lot of anim exploit the nest for shelter and resourc which all somehow have to get in to the fortress without get kill
