virologist think that the reason the strain of bird/ENTITY flu/ENTITY has poor abil to spread between human is that the infect doe not caus cough or sneez scientist led by professor yoshihiro kawaoka at the univers of wisconsin at madison found that avian influenza and human influenza virus infect differ tissu in the respiratori tract anoth group of scientist base at the univers of rotterdam has also publish similar result
professor kawaoka team discov that bird flu tend to be found among deep in the lung human flu is instead most preval in the mucous line of the nose and sinus as well as the throat windpip and bronchi
human flu infect part of the respiratori system that caus cough and sneez when an infect person cough or sneez tini droplet contain the virus are releas into the air which other human can inhal becom infect as bird flu infect the alveoli it doesnt caus cough or sneez and heavi exposur to the virus is requir befor it can get to the lung
professor kawaoka said for the virus to be transmit effici they have to multipli in the upper portion of the respiratori system so that they can be transmit by cough and sneez
for h_n_ to be transmit easili among human it would need to undergo multipl mutat accord to professor kawaoka
certain multipl mutat need to be accumul for the h_n_ to becom a pandem strain he said
these mutat would have to affect where the virus bind in the human bodi and affect the way in which it reproduc
current onli one strain of h_n_ ahong kong_____ has shown the abil to latch onto cell in both the upper and lower part of the human respiratori system
