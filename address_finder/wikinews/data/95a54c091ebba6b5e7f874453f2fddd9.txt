tuesday march __ ____ space/ENTITY shuttl/ENTITY endeavour/ENTITY success launch this morn from launch/ENTITY complex/ENTITY __a/ENTITY at the kennedi/ENTITY space/ENTITY center/ENTITY on mission to assembl the intern/ENTITY space/ENTITY station/ENTITY iss liftoff occur at ______ ____ local time on board was a crew of seven mission command domin/ENTITY gori/ENTITY gregori/ENTITY johnson/ENTITY robert/ENTITY behnken/ENTITY michael/ENTITY foreman/ENTITY richard/ENTITY linnehan/ENTITY takao/ENTITY doi/ENTITY garrett/ENTITY reisman/ENTITY all except reisman will return to earth aboard endeavour in two week time reisman a member of the iss expedit/ENTITY __/ENTITY crew will remain aboard the space station replac léopold/ENTITY eyhart/ENTITY who launch aboard last month
dure the __day the longest shuttl flight in support of the iss the crew will instal two major iss compon the kibō/ENTITY pressuris/ENTITY logist/ENTITY modul/ENTITY and the special/ENTITY purpos/ENTITY dexter/ENTITY manipul/ENTITY spdm the kibō pressuris logist modul is the first of three compon which will form the experi/ENTITY modul/ENTITY jem it will be temporarili instal on a spare dock port of the harmoni/ENTITY modul/ENTITY of the station and will later be fit to the main pressuris experi modul which is slate for launch aboard to be flown by in late may
spdm also known as dextr is a twin robot arm system or remot manipul system rms which will be instal on the end of the space station robot arm it will allow complex task to be complet without the need for a spacewalk extravehicular/ENTITY activ/ENTITY are plan for the mission the first three of these will be to assembl instal and test the dextr spdm this will be follow by an eva to test new tile repair techniqu in the event of a shuttl becom damag on a later mission this test come ahead of the plan mission to servic the hubbl/ENTITY space/ENTITY telescop/ENTITY in august the final eva will be to stow the orbit/ENTITY boom/ENTITY sensor/ENTITY system/ENTITY obss on the space station
this usual remain on the shuttl for launch and land howev as the next mission sts___ is carri a veri larg payload the jem pressuris experi modul the obss cannot be accommod in it payload bay for launch becaus it will be need onc the shuttl reach orbit discoveri will collect the obss from the iss and return it to earth at the end of it mission the obss is use to conduct photographi of the orbit heat shield in order to check for damag similar to that which caus the columbia/ENTITY accid/ENTITY two minor problem occur dure the launch first the primari flash evapor system fail result in a switch to the backup system which perform normal the flash evapor system is use to cool the shuttl prior to the deploy of it radiat the radiat were deploy normal follow payload bay door open onc the shuttl was in orbit the other issu was that instrument fail for a small number of reaction control system rcs thruster which are use to control the shuttl attitud
neither problem is expect to affect the mission the ascent to orbit has been initi assess as clean in term of debri impact the onli concern is a suspect birdstrik ten second after launch howev it is believ that endeavour was not travel fast enough to sustain damag
this is the ___nd launch of the space shuttl the __st of endeavour and the __th shuttl mission to the iss it also mark the ninth and second man orbit launch of launch occur at night make this the shuttl __th night launch this flight was origin schedul to launch on februari __th but after the previous mission was delay due to bad sensor insid the extern fuel tank sts___ was push back to no earlier than march __
