thursday august __ ____ the name robert/ENTITY cailliau/ENTITY may not ring a bell to the general public but his invent is the reason whi you are read this dr cailliau togeth with his colleagu sir/ENTITY tim/ENTITY bernersle/ENTITY invent the world/ENTITY wide/ENTITY web/ENTITY make the access so it could grow from an academ tool to a mass communic medium last januari dr cailliau retir from the european particl physic lab where the www emerg
wikinew offer the engin a virtual beer from his nativ countri and conduct an email interview with him which start about three week ago about the histori and the futur of the web and his life and work
wikinew at the start of this interview we would like to offer you a fresh pint on a terrac but sinc this is an email interview we will limit ourselv to a virtual beer which you can enjoy robert cailliau yes i myself onc at the _nd intern www confer said that there is no such thing as a virtual beer peopl will still want to sit togeth anyway here we go
histori of the www
wikinew whi did the www emerg at a particl physic lab such as cern what need did it serv the scientif communiti at it origin was the make of the www a case of the right time and the right placecircumst for someon with the right it knowledg
robert cailliau there were quit a number of hypertext system around the microcosm hyperg even xanadu everyon was experi there were even two independ attempt insid cern tim and mine cern is an infrastructur use by physicist from all kind of univers who after their experi at cern go back to their institut a singl experi bring togeth mani physicist from univers scatter over the globe obvious they stay in contact they have been user of network and comput for a long time
it therefor not so surpris that we look for a system that would allow such a group to consult document without have to know where the author was or which of the differ comput oper system usernam or password was need there was a need for an autom librari
the two attempt at cern were person initi when i learn that tim want to use the internet and had made progress toward an implement i immedi team up with him but it remain for quit a time a project that was look at with some apprehens by cern manag
it was partial the result of the right peopl in the right place partial chanc but partial driven by a real need and everyth happen under the benevol eye of mike sendal tim boss
wikinew in the begin what challeng did you face insid and outsid cern in the develop of this cuttingedg technolog
robert cailliau a lot of incomprehens later also some jealousi and at the start it was difficult to convinc the manag that it would grow into a use tool
there were a number of factor against us first the period of homegrown it solut was over the trend was to buy offtheshelf softwar
second the entir futur of highenergi physic was precari there were troubl around the superconduct super collid red in the and from the plan of the larg hadron collid red it was clear that someth had to give the ssc was final scrap in ____ but dure the entir period the physicist were worri about other thing than hypertext
third there was alway the problem of justifi a project in pure comput within an institut whose mandat is veri clear the scienc of pure physic
outsid cern there was a desert of hopeless confus network univers want tcpip but the telecom of the european countri were still government monopoli and they resist this becaus they were use to differ payment scheme
i rememb a funni exchang between a person from deutsch/ENTITY telekom/ENTITY and a group of academ at a confer they complain about the cost and the slow link the telecom person repli what do you want we give you the best line and then you run on top of that but we had no choic tcpip was the onli protocol usabl with all univers of the world sir i hope you do not expect that franc telecom will support the internet a repres of franc/ENTITY telecom/ENTITY to robert cailliau
at anoth occas i ask a repres of franc/ENTITY telecom/ENTITY for his email address he gave me an x___ address and i ask for an internet address he rais his eyebrow and said monsieur vous ne pensez quandmêm pas que franc telecom va soutenir linternet sir i hope you do not expect that franc telecom will support the internet and all that happen when the web was alreadi a success though inde onli in the academ world wikinew earli browser were web editor at the same time right what browser do you use today doe it have tab brows how doe it compar to the earli browser youv work with
robert cailliau it is true that the browser of the was also the editor though it was restrict to the page on the local server
the current complex of etc preclud i think the effici combin of the function of edit and brows in a singl applic
someth i do miss are the nextprevi function of the next browser current browser onli permit you to follow a link and then to run back and forth over the path you took back and forward the next browser had the addit function of follow the next link of the previous page next that allow me to make a page which was a list of page to be look at and then to walk that path with a click per page it was a simpl way to establish a path and save it total independ from the target page and the server a kind of digest
i know it possibl to do this with but it is not easi and you cant pass such a page in a simpl way to just anyon
we also had vector/ENTITY graphic/ENTITY im afraid that svg has fail at least i do not see ani site that use it extens
style sheet were also incorpor not veri advanc but the idea was there css did break through
today i use main becaus it use css best and abov all for the typographi even can learn from safari typographi whi is it that so few program handl text well whi is typographi so lousi on the screen tab/ENTITY brows/ENTITY is a concess to those who cant cope with a multitud of separ window dont realli need it the first browser alway open a link page in a new window but window doe not use window it prefer fullscreen mosaic was one of the first browser that use a singl window whi do it simpl when it possibl to complic thing
wikinew search engin have made the mass of data now on the www easili searchabl how initi did you forese the data be index
robert cailliau not at all or by hand we had the virtual librari or vl the idea of index and classifi page about a subject by voluntari work of a specialist in that subject a kind of but with onli the link the content was distribut outsid the vl the vl had a certain success but demand a lot of work the appear of search engin made the vl unimport
the web broke up into server the origin atom of the web was the page now it is the server server link veri rare to other server and then almost alway warn you you will now leav our site in that kind of structur you need a search engin otherwis you cant find anyth but search engin do not let you find your way in the web they give you a refer not a path to follow to get there
the first search engin was built by the centr universitair dinformatiqu of the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY geneva/ENTITY i predict that search engin would not cope in the long term mayb the exist of is onli an indic that there is still onli littl avail on the web robert cailliau jeanfrançoi abramat and tim bernersle at the __th anniversari of the www consortium
wikinew you were at the incept of the www togeth with tim bernersle what aspect are you respons for exact youv convinc cern to releas the basic code librari into the public/ENTITY domain/ENTITY robert cailliau in ____ i had alreadi left program for ten year and was do manag im also _ year older than tim who himself was no longer a young programm it was evid that i could not compet with twenti year old unix hacker and soon i stop meddl with the write of c/ENTITY code/ENTITY anyway i know onli one program languag wors than c and that is javascript
i did influenc the shape of the web and the direct of develop but i main occupi myself with obtain the resourc necessari to keep the project go i had a meager budget and so i got comput offic and abov all peopl young programm who can spend a year work at cern in the framework of it technic student programm to get all that done i had to plead often with the manag
i also understood that cern as a lab for physic would never devot a divis to the web therefor i began to contact true informat institut such as institut nation de recherch en informatiqu et en automatiqu red and fraunhof societi red as well as contact the european commiss in this i was fortun support by mike sendal mike who was seen as neutral by cern manag has done more than anyon els to help the develop of the web insid cern
on the technic side it was not alway the best of understand between me and the team for exampl i was convinc that we need to buildin a program languag but the develop tim first were veri much oppos it had to remain complet declar mayb but the net result is that the programmingvacuum fill itself with the most horribl kluge in the histori of comput javascript
i also rememb a big resist against postscript but what do we see now everywher fortun pdf is an open standard and it fair eleg but it could have turn out much wors svg did not make it tim who had a longer experi with the internet world convinc me that the web could onli surviv if all the code was freeli avail for everyon put into the public domain the document was sign on __ april ____ that gave the www technolog to the world robert cailliau
tim who had a longer experi with the internet world convinc me that the web could onli surviv if all the code was freeli avail for everyon who want to tinker with it in ________ i then work patient for some _ month with cern legal servic to draft a document that put the sourc code into the public domain this also impli work to convinc the manag up to the director of the need to do so the result was the document sign on __ april ____ that gave the www technolog to the world
dure the same period i also perceiv that the web as a technolog had veri mani aspect tim drew what he call the metro a diagram of the relationship between the exist system ftp smtp http in the form of a stylis map resembl that of the london/ENTITY underground/ENTITY that made me think that we need to deal with a lot more hard comput scienc than our small team of four or five could intellectu handl therefor i began to toy with the idea of an intern confer on www technolog tim was not convinc but i went ahead
ncsa the nation/ENTITY center/ENTITY for/ENTITY supercomput/ENTITY applic/ENTITY in the us had just releas first for the system then for their group not onli had a lot more peopl but their leader joseph hardin was a sociologist of my age i suspect that he was think along the same line and i was right when i launch the call for paper for the first www confer in decemb ____ i did so just one day befor ncsa would have done the same thing
it was a friday and on saturday hardin phone me at home to discuss the matter fortun our relat were good and he was also veri fair by team up with my confer in the end
but our team at the time was veri weak ncsa had a big success with mosaic and they could easili have use their weight to wipe us off the map
it was also a time to understand how underdevelop our idea of europ here is we know that we have to live togeth on this assembl of peninsula but when we have to pull in the same direct then that is polit rather difficult
final for two year i work quit hard contribut to the set up of the web/ENTITY consortium/ENTITY even afterward that took much effort and a lot of my time
wikinew there are some fun anecdot about the begin of the world wide web weve just offer you a virtual beer but the idea of the www start with a beer too in this case with a real beer with tim bernersle right and there is a reason that the origin wwwlogo is green right whi is it not call worldwid web with a hyphen are there other anecdot you want to share with our reader
robert cailliau the list is without end
at the second confer held by ncsa in chicago someon ask if it was not better to use the web for confer instead of travel to far place implus i answer in front of ____ programm in the audienc that there was no such thing as a virtual beer and therefor we prefer to meet in the flesh that was ____
in ____ month befor there was a shred of code tim and i want to find a good name for the project sometim after a hard day work in warm offic we drank a beer on the cern cafeteria terrac befor go home on one such occas tim came up with worldwid web i would have prefer someth shorter but to find a catch name is not easi i agre to use www for the new document that was to go to manag and find a better name later www stay it summaris well what it was
becaus im a i see charact in colour and i perceiv a w as green i like that so it remain www and there was inde a logo that we use a lot in the begin it was made from three ws white light green and darker green closeup of a pin hand out at the first confer
and yes the hyphen was there for a long time too but it confus peopl who were not so grammat and tim final cut the knot by state that he had the right to decid how it was written sinc he had invent it without the hyphen
some anecdot were less funni at one time i could have made alexand totic of ncsa come to cern to join us that was almost arrang when it appear that alex had a passport and cern at the time did not admit serb
the most recent and veri posit anecdot is from octob ____ i gave the open keynot at an australian confer on elearn and the internet in educ i start out by say i knew noth about educ but would give my keynot anyway in a later talk jean johnson present notschool url and mention that the project web for school of the european/ENTITY commiss/ENTITY had been veri import for her work
later i ask her whether she meant the project that end in a confer in in ____ she said yes and ask if i had been there i then had to admit that i had start that project myself and address the audienc at the close session of the dublin confer and therefor mayb i did know a littl about internet in educ it was heartwarm to know that even smaller initi had been quit import
wikinew while tim bernersle wasnt enthusiast about it you call for the first intern www confer how did those confer shape the www
robert cailliau the confer still run the ____ one was in they are an occas to meet and work veri hard for a few day at the exchang of idea the paper of the present are publish in wellknown academ journal that incit peopl to prepar well and present to colleagu mani web technolog start at one of the confer proxi vrml work group are establish there becaus mani want to go but can do so onli when fund by their institut or compani it often mean they have to present a paper vagu idea are then consolid and cast into program code which otherwis might not happen
in addit the confer committe soon convinc the web consortium to hold one of it annual meet in conjunct with the confer i am no longer involv with this but at least dure the year ____ to ____ this synergi was present and a track of the confer was devot to the work of the consortium therefor tim was also present everi year
i alway saw the consortium as the church with tim as the pope in the consortium there is a set of rule for arriv at decis after which everyon has to abid by them there are industri and sometim polit stake
the confer howev as long as i was member of the committe i saw as the state of laymen you had freedom of express and could propos the most wild scheme between church and state i prefer a complet separ
that did not mean of cours that we did not collabor close between consortium and confer committe there alway was a deleg of the consortium member of the committe although that was not a requir we want both to be success
wikinew relat to that i have been told the www was initi to run on who had that idea and whi do you believ it never came about
robert cailliau it never was in the origin goal to use micropay howev for keynot speaker of the first confer may ____ i had invit david schaum an expert in digit money i was therefor alreadi then convinc of the need for digit money payment with guarante valu but not traceabl origin we still do not have anyth like that to me a much more import reason to introduc digit money than untrac is a free market for inform
the idea of digit payment were target sale of good and payment of subscript to me it is more import to break the vicious triangl of authorreaderadvertis
in the begin i was often complet misunderstood there were even newspap articl that led to hatemail through incomprehens
the principl of an inform market with micropay is simpl and it is not new the french has had it sinc the earli __s
there are current three way to put info on the web
for free but who pay my time
by subscript with a name and password valid for a certain length of time
by solicit advertis to put their ad on the site
manner _ can onli if i have other sourc of incom
manner _ is use often but put off peopl becaus of the high level of the subscript
that bar the reader from use mani differ site eg to brows mani newspap the sum of the subscript is too high
for exampl i sometim want to look up a word in the oxford/ENTITY english/ENTITY dictionari/ENTITY but not so often that i find it worth my while to pay for the subscript therefor i cant use it at all
manner _ is the most use even if that is not pleasant for the user for exampl via/ENTITY michelin/ENTITY an excel servic has recent becom veri irrit becaus it carri so much advertis in addit anim as well so that it is difficult to concentr on what i want to do there for all the move stuff advert especi the anim varieti is a pest on use site
with micropay and digit money i would be abl to pay oxford a tini sum for each time i consult the dictionari but without have to pay a full subscript
a good implement of micropay must also provid comfort i should not have to log in or agre my comput automat pay behind the scene we are talk here of sum of less than a euroc
and i could of cours set limit by tell the browser to warn me if i spend more than __ euro a day or when a site charg more than a cent for a page etc
in this way i could read the news in sever paper without have to pay a complet subscript to each and have to log in if they want site can of cours also distinguish between a pay entranc after which there are no more advert and thing work faster and an entranc that is free but full of advert
in short there is then a true market for inform direct between the seller and the custom noth is obligatori but a lot more is possibl with the euro it is now perhap time to tri an experi with micropay
wikinew the web was invent in europ but it grew exponenti and to some extent the invent has explod in your face at ani point did you feel that the www had been hijack by the unit state
robert cailliau the web was hijack by those who put someth in it they are the peopl who did not make long ideolog or socal intellectu reason but who put content there the approach differ great between our european parochi littl cultur for exampl on the whole french compani are pretti bad on the web there is a lot of aesthet ado but you cant find the inform you are look for the site even those written in french are much more direct and inform
the dutch do better than the belgian there is a larg differ between the privat sector and govern agenc the site of the french govern are a model of complet user friendli and use almost complet the opposit of the site of the privat compani of the same countri
i did not make a studi of this phenomenon but it seem there are two larg influenc approach to life protestantpragmaticexperimentalgerman versus catholicintellectualcartesianlatin and languag
it obvious that there is more avail in english say than in basqu but that should not surpris anyon ok so we have a languag problem in europ that lead to one of my favourit subject languag as a technolog but that for anoth interview
wikinew how much has the web evolv sinc the ____s what factor are hinder further evolut
robert cailliau you probabl mean the __s unless you want to talk internet instead of web look back and from the mani convers with web and internet pioneer i think not much has chang fundament
there was a first explos of internet servic in the __s email chat file transfer remot login then a paus with noth much until the web involv the public at larg from ____ two grand phase then academ develop follow by explos in the public sphere
we must rememb two incompat communic model telephoni no guarante contact but guarante bandwidth and internet guarante contact but no guarante bandwidth circuit switch and packet switch fashion dictat that we should now do everyth via tcpip that fine al long as there is no need for continu contact email web download but it is never good enough when that need is present audio video tv not to mention telesurgeri would you like to be on the oper tabl know that the surgeon on the other side has just tcpip between his hand and the scalpel probabl not
there are applic that need a guarante bandwidth and that not achiev with classic tcpip of cours the mathematician and the network geek will tell you that there is no differ if you make the bandwidth high enough true but i fear that you can also alway find an applic that bandwidth hungri enough that those limit need to be put higher again
mayb we find a combin wherebi the web is use to initi a circuit so that the best of both approach can be had
wikinew what part or period of the histori of the world wide web did you enjoy most which were the most excit time
robert cailliau enjoy onli afterward except the first confer there was a euphor atmospher that i have seldom experienc and becaus i start it myself it was extrem satisfi
the most excit period was from end ____ to end ____ it was the earli period where we sens veri clear where we want to go but had to instil that vision in other
it last until the end of www at cern in decemb ____ i cannot relat the whole stori here it is told in detail in the book how the web was born
wikinew if you could go back into time and chang one thing about the start of the www what would it be
robert cailliau isambard/ENTITY kingdom/ENTITY brunel/ENTITY one of the greatest engin of all time wrote in ____ at the height of the railway mania here the whole world is railway mad i am realli sick of hear propos made i wish it were at an end i prefer engin veri much to project of which i keep as clear as i can
the dread scrambl in which i am oblig to get through my busi is by no mean a good sampl of the way in which work ought to be done i wish i could suggest a plan that would great diminish the number of project it would suit my interest and those of my client perfect if all railway work were stop for sever year to come i thought often of that reflect we advanc far too fast with far too mani develop who ran away in far too mani differ direct without much think
i dont want to be cartesian here but it would have been better if we had more time to build on our idea befor let the beast loos we advanc far too fast with far too mani develop who ran away in far too mani differ direct without much think especi the geek in the us often behav like cowboy shoot first think later robert cailliau
especi the geek in the us often behav like cowboy shoot first think later featur were implement that look attract on first sight but turn out to be incompat with other one for exampl the famous frame that we still have not got rid of
peopl fail to understand the advantag of separ content from present which we had on the next in some sens especi graphic artist refus this and that put us back by about five year
if a care studi were made it might well show that we lost much more time and effort manag excess than we would have spent in a more consider and pace develop
i often had the impress i was run like mad to escap from drown in a tsunami
futur of the www
wikinew ive read that scientist at cern are current work on grid/ENTITY comput/ENTITY main to process the huge amount of data from the larg/ENTITY hadron/ENTITY collid/ENTITY project do you think grid comput will be the next generat web are there restrict that limit the use of grid comput for exampl work over larg distanc
robert cailliau about grid comput i have not much to say the first intent of the and later the intenet was the use of comput resourc at a distanc grid comput is an extrapol of that idea i dont know if the averag user will use grid comput most probabl not it seem to me that person comput stand to grid comput like serial comput stand to parallel comput there are use applic of parallel comput but i dont think my second processor is busi while im type this grid comput can be use behind the scene in certain servic but i find it hard to see what the web surfer will use it for googl know what to do with it im sure so ill shut up about it
wikinew youv said befor that you dont care a lot about the concept of web/ENTITY __/ENTITY becaus it was someth you envis from the begin and it was someth bound to happen correct if not what is your vision for the web what would be a real web renaiss freeli contribut to web content was one of the origin goal the web should be as easi to write as it is to read anoth function we lost due to too fast develop robert cailliau
robert cailliau web __ is someth that inde exist but it is not a technolog it is a social phenomenon that requir the simultan deploy of a number of technolog to build the socal __ websit deliv web content via blog and the like is a new happen in which the individu particip often in veri origin way freeli contribut to web content was one of the origin goal the web should be as easi to write as it is to read anoth function we lost due to too fast develop
im much more worri about data all my data are on my home comput and i regular back them up i have noth import on a server no email no photo video or whatev but im an except most peopl never back up their machin and actual cannot handl a comput they use the machin as a termin to the internet
servic such as gmail and in fact everi site have some kind of my where one leav a bit of oneself bring us back to the archaic model of comput central mainfram and storag use through termin on which no local applic run
this trend start to worri me with email first becaus of spam most stop relay mail and i began to have some troubl send email while on travel to send mail you have to know the local smtp server but which hotel receptionist can tell you that they stare blank at you incap of understand that you do not use web mail ie that you do not have your messag on a server
money is virtual it is a number on a comput in a bank somewher we trust the bank nobodi has gold coin in a sock under the mattress
but we have been work on the bank establish for a few centuri the last time we had a great crash depress of ____ not onli a larg number of peopl die of hunger but it help bring about the most totalitarian state we ever wit the third reich sinc those day we have learn a lot pain and with lot of mishap
therefor now we think that we can trust the bank and the economist with our money the breakthrough came from govern control and intern convent
with our data it is now as it was with money about two centuri ago everyth is in the hand of uncontrol privat compani without ani legal framework to say noth of intern agreement
but my data are a part of myself i want to know how my data are manag by whom where and with what guarante money i may lose but then i grow my potato in my garden
you speak of a webrenaiss that would be a brilliant light that would let us see that in the informationdriven era we need to build new social structur new form of creat trust and we need more transpar in the process of societi
wikinew the principl behind wiki such as wikipedia provid similar function to earli web browser that were web editor at the same time to which extent is this analog correct
robert cailliau the one great differ mayb is that wiki run on server but i can of cours put a wiki on my home comput or laptop it not realli but that is not so import
wikinew do you see wiki as a viabl longterm model or do you expect someth els to emerg on the subject of wiki do you refer to wikipedia
robert cailliau i use the wikipedia often i also contribut here and there a veri great work look at with a lot of jealousi in almost all comment about the wikipedia i perceiv in the background some jealousi and intoler
there seem to be a strong reaction from those who deriv their prestig from secret knowledg and consequ find it rather scandal that everyth is now not onli lie around to be read but also often debunk their prejudic
the wikipedia is full of error mayb but print book too and they do not get correct it is also total unrealist to compar the wikipedia with a work like the for which you need a subscript becaus we have no micropay one should compar the wikipedia with what peopl have in their home often noth or in their head if the wikipedia is as good as the brittanica then hat off
are wiki viabl in the longer term i think so they give author a frame to work in whatev come later that frame is import
wikinew youv edit your own articl on wikipedia did you find it easi to work with you probabl dont have a lot of experi with it but what is your impress of the softwar that wikipedia run on
robert cailliau i find it veri good precis becaus i do not use it often it is import that it is suffici simpl and intuit that i do not need a manual the wiki softwar fulfil this criterion and is therefor veri good the frame is import
wikinew will it be possibl to agre on common standard with the softwar compani tri to push their own standard are there major obstacl for xml
robert cailliau we can appar agre on common standard os x is full of xml and even microsoft now use xml for it offic product
proprietari standard are not bad in themselv they let one tri out new thing or be effici in some way i do not object to them on one condit that there is a way to export all data in an xml form with all the detail i could control through the applic transmit to the xml in recognis form
the w_ consortium succeed in spread the www standard and did even more sever commerci standard converg under it influenc
that is the good news
wikinew lawmak are lag behind when it come to comput and informationtechnolog on your site you say in a societi base on technolog it is simpli danger to make polici on the basi of languag construct onli what is the altern to languagebas polici
robert cailliau a few year ago i had to speak about url the european/ENTITY parliament/ENTITY i was shock that there was no way to use anyth els than spoken languag no screen no projector no whiteboard how can one say anyth sensibl about climat chang without show map graph video but perhap we should first work on the scientif literaci of our politician mayb that wont be necessari if the next form of govern grow from web __ i just discov newropean url who know the old technolog of the spoken languag alon certain no longer work
wikinew there were recent report in the belgian media about the rise of report internet crime doe that illustr your call for intern regul of internet behaviour if someon pose problemat behaviour on the internet how should he or she be dealt with
robert cailliau what do we use in common law the polic search for the offend and work through a number of procedur there are rule for establish complic on the net it is onli differ becaus time and space break down there
problemat behaviour as you euphemist call it can be exhibit from anywher and it usual goe veri fast we therefor need a worldwid law there are howev at least three larg legal framework in conflict here the european the us and the chines system make those work togeth is a problem that i do not see solv in time
what upset me too is the idea that it is the respons of the isp or servic to act recent remov a number of user that were known as sex offend they must have use some regist who decid that who transmit the regist the reaction of scotland/ENTITY yard/ENTITY was right it not becaus these peopl had commit an offenc that they should be exclud forev certain not when they had serv their sentenc or we should first chang the law but we see more and more case in which commerci compani take the law in their own hand we see more and more case in which commerci compani take the law in their own hand and that make me worri about what the commerci sector will do in the vacuum that the govern just let be robert cailliau
and that make me worri about what the commerci sector will do in the vacuum that the govern just let be much more than about what govern would do
that in turn is relat to my worri over leav my data in the hand of site rather than have full control myself
let not forget that the sex offend mayb did noth wrong in myspac the term of myspac are veri simpl they have the right to do what they want and to exclud you when they want without reason in addit they transfer all your data to the us although they are honest enough to warn you that the protect of privat data in the us may be differ no i prefer to stay away from social site in these circumst
final do these sex offend have a telephon that is allow and they can use the post offic and the road system with their car yeah let just keep on mess about
what we need to clarifi is where the right and duti are as guid we still have furthermor i have been plead for year now for an internet drive licenc last week i heard someth similar said in the british/ENTITY hous/ENTITY of/ENTITY common/ENTITY wikinew wikipedia say the semant/ENTITY web/ENTITY deriv from w_c director sir tim bernersle vision of the web as a univers medium for data inform and knowledg exchang yet your not a fan of the semant web right is that becaus the semant web will have as a result that our daili live will be handl by machin talk to machin or are you in favour of a spread of protocol for differ type of transact and data
robert cailliau a difficult question i would like to have a good semant web but i think that the possibl for abus and mislead are greater with a semant web tim agre with that when i submit the problem to him but he is a steadi believ in the good of human
it a theme that run through this interview whom can you trust and how do you make the rule that will keep problemat behaviour within bound onli a worldwid convent can help and we are far away from it it also a littl earli to use intellig machineri you have no idea how half wit machin can be mayb here too we should think and experi first befor we let the beast loos robert cailliau
it also a littl earli to use intellig machineri befor we reach artifici intellig we need to cross the desert of the halfwit machin and you have no idea how half wit machin can be
my attitud toward the semant web is also like to the remark that we went too fast mayb here too we should think and experi first befor we let the beast loos
wikinew can you predict the futur of the internet are you optimist or will it be the/ENTITY matrix/ENTITY but wors
robert cailliau matrix but wors flight from realiti is an unavoid side effect of our brain structur sinc thousand of year peopl prefer to listen to fairi tale than face the bore realiti still i think web __ is a good trend blog wikipedia ring all these achiev come from simpl peopl sit behind their home comput who share with other what they experi and abov all learn from other this learn outsid school is the biggest strength of the web and most hopegiv
