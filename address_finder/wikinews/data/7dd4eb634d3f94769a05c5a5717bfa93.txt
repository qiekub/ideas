in find publish sunday in environment/ENTITY intern/ENTITY a team from univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY exet/ENTITY report that are rough three time as like to hous escherichia/ENTITY coli/ENTITY and other bacteria that could easili becom resist than other peopl who recreat in the coastal water of the unit kingdom a surfer in northern california be spray with seawat one studi show that surfer swallow much more seawat than swimmer epidemiolog/ENTITY studi/ENTITY was nicknam the beach/ENTITY bum/ENTITY survey/ENTITY the project was perform on ___ regular surfer bodi/ENTITY surfer/ENTITY and bodyboard from around the unit kingdom each surfgo particip was ask to recruit a nonsurf friend of the same sex and approxim age and who live in the same part of the countri to serv as a control which result in a control/ENTITY group/ENTITY of ___
all particip mail in rectal swab and the research cultur the e coli from those sampl with a common antibiot call the antibiot fail to kill the bacteria in about _ __ out of ___ of surfer and bodyboard sampl and _ of the sampl from the control group _ out of ___ a deeper look into the genom of the specif strain of bacteria found in the studi volunt show that bacteria from surfer were four time as like to possess gene that can be transfer from one bacteri strain to anoth which can help antibioticsuscept bacteria becom resist the studi also involv examin of water sampl from the coast of to estim the risk of surfer and other beachgoer ingest e coli
e coli is a regular resid in the gut of human and other anim most strain are harmless but other can caus serious diseas like other bacteria e coli can undergo horizont/ENTITY gene/ENTITY transfer/ENTITY swap gene from one bacterium to anoth this can give the alter strain the abil to caus diseas surviv in the presenc of antibiot or both
although the research express concern surfer might spread danger bacteria dr will gaze the univers of exet medic school profession who supervis the project urg peopl not to avoid the beach we are not seek to discourag peopl from spend time in the sea an activ which has a lot of benefit in term of exercis wellb and connect with natur he said it is import that peopl understand the risk involv so that they can make inform decis about their bath and sport habit we now hope that our result will help policymak beach manag and water compani to make evidencebas decis to improv water qualiti even further for the benefit of public health e coli bacteria at _____ time magnif
david smith scienc and polici offic of surfer/ENTITY against/ENTITY sewag/ENTITY which help organis the volunt agre the studi was not meant to discourag surf water qualiti in the uk has improv vast in the past __ year and is some of the cleanest in europ recognis coastal water as a pathway for antibiot resist can allow polici maker to make chang to protect water user and the wider public from the threat of antibiot resist
one of the princip find of this work was that exist method may have been underestim the preval of these bacteria in seawat previous studi have shown that even design swim beach can be affect by runoff from farm or even sewag and surfer swallow rough ten time as much seawat as swimmer professor colin gardner of the chariti antibiot research uk say these form of runoff can have even higher concentr of antibiot than patient undergo antibiot treatment research into new medicin to replac our archaic antibiot has stagnat and unless new treatment are found this could be potenti devast for human health he warn world/ENTITY health/ENTITY organ/ENTITY has report that becaus so mani kind of bacteria are gain resist to common medicin condit such as may becom more difficult to treat and have higher rate of sick and death doctor often prescrib prevent antibiot to patient undergo surgeri or radiat therapi and this may also be impact professor salli/ENTITY davi/ENTITY chief/ENTITY medic/ENTITY offic/ENTITY has describ a postantibiot apocalyps scenario european/ENTITY region/ENTITY develop/ENTITY fund/ENTITY natur/ENTITY environ/ENTITY research/ENTITY council/ENTITY provid fund for the studi
