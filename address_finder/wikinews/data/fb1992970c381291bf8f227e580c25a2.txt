postrac statement this was a realli import stage today but there are still three veri import stage to come and i have to be good in each one of them if i want to win the tour de franc i could yet have a bad day in the final and the overal champion of the race cannot afford to falter at ani time im awar that it possibl for me to have a bad day but that can happen to rasmussen too at the moment howev hes the leader and he continu to demonstr that hes realli strong
today i have made time gain on cadel evan now i have to attack rasmussen and i will tri to do just that my team decid to take it respons just like what saunier duval tri to do in the leadup to the first mountain pass but it didnt work out for them we sent hincapi and popovych to the front lead to the final climb to take charg and then i chose the moment to attack when my leg were good

that is probabl the most difficult climb and stage finish of the entir race the tour has been up here a few time befor and the like of pantani and armstrong have won here so it would have been nice to put my name to that list but i didnt succeed in that but it was a good victori for alberto im still happi howev with the outcom of today
my team was ride veri strong today that for sure i was tri to hold them back a littl bit becaus we still have more than ___ kilomet of ride in the pyrene ahead of us and the battl is far from over i didnt want them to ride too hard but it was difficult to hold them back today
i got to a point where i realiz okay i might not win the stage but i will be abl to thin out the field of rival quit signific so i work all the way to the line and obvious contador had the better posit for the sprint but it not over with you there a long way to go and with the time trial on the final saturday i think we need to accept that a lot can chang anyon within six or seven minut of me can win at this point
