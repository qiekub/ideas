wn yeah well the men are go to for their world championship while the women go to toronto and of cours the next paralymp is in tina mckenzi yeah i know
wn it will be a veri differ climat and veri differ food
tina mckenzi we all learn to adjust i have over the year ive been a vegetarian for the last thirteen year twelv year mayb so you learn to actual take food with you and you learn to adjust know what environ your go in to and what work for you i have often carri around can of red/ENTITY kidney/ENTITY bean/ENTITY i know that i can put that in lettuc or in salad and get through with a bit of protein and you know sarah/ENTITY stewart/ENTITY doe a terrif job be a vegan and manag the differ area and countri that weve been in to germani for exampl is high depend on the meat side of food and im pretti sure i rememb in germani i live on pasta and spaghetti tomato sauc yeah that was it laugh that alright you just learn i think it realli hard for the new girl that come in to the team it so overwhelm at the best of time anyway and their nerv are realli quit wrack id say and that differ travel environ is realli hard so i think the more experi they can get in travel and play intern the better off theyll be for rio
wn one of the thing that struck me about the australian team i hadnt seen the glider befor london it was an amaz experi see you guy come out on the court for the first time at the marshmallow
tina mckenzi laugh
wn it was probabl all old hat to you guy youd been practic for month certain sinc in juli
tina mckenzi it was pretti amaz yeah i think it doesnt realli matter how mani paralymp you actual do be abl to come out on that court wherev it is it never dull it alway an amaz experi and you feel quit honor and realli proud to be there and it still give you a tingl in your stomach it not like oh off i go bore of this
wn especi that last night there at the north/ENTITY greenwich/ENTITY arena/ENTITY there were thirteen thousand peopl there they open up some extra part of the stadium i could not even see the top row they were in dark
tina mckenzi it an amaz sport to come and watch and it an amaz sport to play it a good spectat sport i think peopl should come and see especi the girl play it quit tough and i was talk to someon yesterday and it was like oh i dont know how you play that you know it so rough you must get so hurt it great excel you know brilliant game that teach you lot of strategi and you can actual take all those strategi off the court and into your life as well so it teach you a lot of disciplin a lot of structur and it a big thing it not just about be on the court and throw a ball around
wn when i saw you last you were in sydney and you said you were move down to melbourn whi was that
tina mckenzi to move to melbourn my mum down here and i live here for sixteen year or someth
wn i know you live here for a long time but you move up to sydney did your teacher degre up there
tina mckenzi i move to sydney to go to uni and macquari/ENTITY univers/ENTITY were amaz in the support that they actual gave me be abl to studi and play basketbal intern the scholarship realli help me out and you know it wasnt just about the scholarship it was deidr anderson was incred shes actual from melbourn as well but her support emot and how are you do when shed run into you and was alway veri good at read peopl where theyr at she total understand at the level of play at nation level and intern level and so it wasnt just about macquari support me financi it was about them support me the whole way through and that was how i got through my degre and was abl to play at that level for such a long time
wn and you like teach
tina mckenzi yeah i do yeah i do im still wait on my transfer at the moment from new/ENTITY south/ENTITY wale/ENTITY but teach good it realli nice to be abl to spend some time with kid and i think it realli import for kid to be actual around peopl with disabl to actual normal us a littl bit and not be so profound about meet someon that look a littl bit differ and if i can do that at a young age in primari school and let them see that life pretti normal for me then i think that a realli import lesson
wn you retir just after the paralymp
tina mckenzi i did yeah actual it took me quit a long time to decid to do that i actual travel after london so i backpack around i went to the and then to europ and i spent a lot of time travel and see amaz new thing and spend time by myself and reflect on so yes i got to spend quit a bit of time reflect on my career and where i want to go
wn your basketbal career or your teach career
tina mckenzi all the abov yeah everyth realist and i think it was a realli import time for me to sort of decid sort of where i want to go in myself id spent sixteen year with the glider so that a long time to be around the glider appar tina mckenzi no _ at right listen to the australian nation anthem prior to the match against the unit state at the ____ summer paralymp
wn when did you join them for the first time
tina mckenzi i think it was __ no no no sorri no no no __ well say ____ yeah ____ was my first tournament against usa so we play usa up in new south wale in the energi australia tour so we travel the coast play up at it was a pretti amaz experi be my first time play for australia and it was just a friend competit so long time ago and that was lead into ____ into the big sydney/ENTITY olymp/ENTITY that was the begin of an amaz journey realist but go back to whi i retir or think about retir i think when i came home i decid to spend a littl bit more time with mum caus wed actual lost my dad he pass away two year ago he got realli sick after i came back from world cup in ____ late ____ he was realli unwel so i spent a lot of time down here i actual had a coupl of month off from the glider becaus i need to deal with the famili and i think that it was realli good to be abl to get back and get on the team and i love play basketbal but after be away and ive done three paralymp ive been up for four campaign i think it time now to actual take a step backward and well not backward take a step out of it and spend qualiti time with mum and qualiti time with peopl that have support me throughout the year of me not be around home but float back in and float out again and it a realli it a nice time for me to be abl to also take on my teach career and tri to teach and train and work full time is realli hard work and i think it also time for quit a few of the new girl to actual step up and weve got quit a few youv got caitlin and youv got kati and youv got shelley and georgia there quit a few nice girl come through that will fit realli well into the team and it a great opportun for me to go it my time now see where they go with that and retir from the glider it was a hard decis not an easi decis to retir i definit miss it but i think now id rather focus on mayb help out at the foundat level of start recruit and build up a recruit side in melbourn and get new girl to come along and play basketbal peopl with doesnt even have to be girl but just tri to refe our foundat level of basketbal and if i can do that now i think that still give toward the glider and roller eventu that would be realli nice just about refocus i dont want to complet leav basketbal id still like to be part of it look to the develop side of thing and mayb have a littl bit more input in that area would be realli nice though give back the skill ive been taught over the year and be a bit of an educ in that area i think would be nice it realli hard when your at that intern level to your so time poor that it realli hard to be abl to focus on all that recruit and be abl to give out skill day when your actual tri to focus on improv yourself so now ive got that time that i could actual do that be a littl bit more involv in mentor mayb someth like that yeah that what id like to do
wn that would be good
tina mckenzi yeah that would be great actual so ive just been put on the board of disabl sport and recreat which is the old wheelchair sport victoria so that been a nice begin move see where all the sport are at and what were actual facilit in victoria consid ive been away from victoria for so long it nice to know where theyr all at
wn where are they all at
tina mckenzi yeah dunno theyr not veri far at all victoria i think victoria is realli struggl in the basketbal world yeah i think there a bit of a struggl back in the day back in those old time where victoria would be run local comp wed have an a grade and a b grade on a thursday night and wed have twelv team in a grade and b grade play wheelchair basketbal that a huge amount of peopl play and when you start in b grade youd be hope that you came around and someon from a grade would ask you to come and play so it was a realli nice way to build your basketbal skill up and get to know that communiti and i think it realli import to have a communiti peopl that you actual feel comfort and safe around i dont want to say it a communiti of disabl peopl it actual
wn it not realli becaus
tina mckenzi well it not the communiti massiv it not just someon be in a chair youv got your refere youv got peopl that are come along to support you and it a beauti communiti i alway rememb call it a famili and it like a famili so and it not just australiabas it intern it quit incred it realli love but it about provid that communiti for new player to come through and you know not everi player that come through to play basketbal want to be a paralympian so it about actual provid sport opportun for peopl to be physic activ and if they do want to compet for australia and theyr good enough well then we support that but i think it realli hard in the femal side of thing there not as mani femal with a disabl
wn yeah they kept on point that out
tina mckenzi it realli hard but i think one of the other thing is that we also need to be abl to get the sport out there into the general communiti and it not just about have a disabl it about come along and play with your mate that might be classifi or an exbasketbal player like i was talk to a friend of mine the other day and shes six foot two
wn sound like a basketbal player alreadi
tina mckenzi shes been a basketbal player an ab basketbal player for year grew up play over in adelaid and her knee is so bad that she cant run anymor and she cant cycl but yet want to be physic activ and im like oooh you can come along and play wheelchair basketbal and shes like i didnt even think that i could do that so it about promot it not that you actual have to be full time in the chair or be someon with an amput or other congenit like a spinal disabl it wear and tear on peopl bodi and such
wn someth i notic in the crowd in london peopl seem to think that they were in the chair all the time and were surpris when most of the roller got up out of their chair at the end of the game
tina mckenzi yeah
wn disabl is a veri complic thing
tina mckenzi it is yeah
wn i was surpris myself at peopl who were alway in a chair but yet can wiggl their toe
tina mckenzi yeah it the preconceiv thing like if you see someon in a chair a lot of peopl just think that noth work but in hindsight there are so mani vari level of disabl some peopl dont need to be in a chair all the time sometim they need to be in it occasion yeah it kind of a hard thing
wn also talk to the classifi and they mention the peopl play wheelchair basketbal who have no disabl at all but are import to the differ team that carri their bag and stuff
tina mckenzi so import yeah it the support network and i think that when we start develop women nation leagu to start in ____ one of the model that we took that off was the canadian women nation leagu they run an amaz nation leagu with huge amount of abl bodi women come in and play it and they travel all over canada play against each other and they do have a round robin in certain area like our women nation leagu as well but it so popular over there that it hard to get on the team they have a certain amount of women with disabl and then other abl bodi women that just want to come along and play becaus they see it as a realli great sport and that how we tri to model our women nation leagu off it about get mani women just to play sport realist
wn get women to play sport whether disabl or not is anoth stori and there seem to be a reluct amongst women to particip in sport particular sport that they regard as be men sport
tina mckenzi yeah a masculin sport
wn they would much rather play a sport that is a women sport
tina mckenzi yeah it realli hard i think it about just encourag peopl communic have a realli nice welcom come and tri day we run a like sarah stewart actual this yeah will be run the women festiv of sport which is on the __th of januari and that an amaz tournament that actual start from club championship day where we use to run club championship and then the club championship then use to feed in to our women nation leagu club championship use to about get as mani women to come along and play whether theyr ab or have a disabl it just about particip itll be a realli fun weekend and it a pretti easi weekend for some of us tina mckenzi no _ at right on the court in the quarter final against mexico
wn where is it
tina mckenzi next year in ____ itll be januari the __th at we hold it everi year and last year we got the girl to come along and play so we had half of the goalbal girl come and play for the weekend and they had an absolut brilliant time find young girl that are walk down the street that just want to come and play sport or they have a friend at high school that has a disabl and it just about have a nice weekend meet other peopl that have disabl or not have disabl and just play togeth it a brilliant weekend and everi year we alway have new face come along and we hope that those new face stay around and enjoy the weekend becaus it no so high competit it just about just play like last year i brought three or four friend of mine flew up from melbourn ab just to come along and play it was realli nice that i had the opportun to play a game of basketbal with the friend that i hang out with which was realli nice so the sport not just paralymp
wn how doe victoria compar with new south wale
tina mckenzi oh that a thing to ask laugh look i think both state go in high and low in differ thing i think all the polici that have been chang in whos support who and like wheelchair sport new south wale do a good job at support the basketbal communiti of cours there alway a willing for more money to come in but they run a fair good support and so doe the new/ENTITY south/ENTITY wale/ENTITY institut/ENTITY of/ENTITY sport/ENTITY it definit gotten better sinc i first start up there and then it realli hard to compar becaus both state do thing veri differ yeah realli differ and i alway rememb be in victoria i dunno when that was in earli ____ new south wale had an amaz program it seem so much more support than what we had down here in victoria but then even go to new south wale and see the program that they have up there it wasnt as brilliant as the grass isnt alway greener on the other side caus there there good thing and there were werent so great thing about the both program in victoria and in new south wale so the vis victorian/ENTITY institut/ENTITY of/ENTITY sport/ENTITY do some great support with some of the athlet down here and nswis new south wale institut of sport are build and improv and i know their program chang quit a lot now with tom kyle and ben osborn be involv with nswis so i cant realli give feedback on how that program run but in short i know that when nswis employ ben osborn to come along and actual coach us as a basketbal individu and as in group session it was the best thing that they ever did like it was so good to be abl to have one coach to actual go and go we do an individu session or when are you run group session and it just help me it help you train it was just a realli it was benefici wherea victoria dont have that at the moment so both state struggl some day i mean back in ____ victoria had six or seven glider player and then new south wale had as mani and then it kind of doe a big swap it depend on what the state infrastructur is what the support network is and how local comp are run how the nation leagu run and it about number it all about number
wn at the moment youll notic a larg conting of glider from western/ENTITY australia/ENTITY tina mckenzi yes yes i have seen that yeah and that good becaus it what happen is someon come along in either state or wherev it may be and theyr huge passion about build and improv that side of thing and they have the time to give to it and that what happen in wa western australia which has been great ben/ENTITY ettridg/ENTITY has been amaz and so has and then in new south wale you have drive that year ago gerri has alway been a huge passion man about improv number about particip and individu improv you know so hes been quit a passion man about make sure peopl are improv individu and you know gerri hewson been quit a driver of wheelchair basketbal in new south wale hes been an import factor i think
wn the news recent has been basketbal/ENTITY australia/ENTITY take over the run of thing the glider now have a full time coach
tina mckenzi yeah which is fantast that excit it a good profession move you know it nice to actual know that that what happen and i think that onli will lead to improv of all the girl and the glider may go from one level up to the next level which is fantast so and tom sound like a great man so i realli hope that he enjoy himself
wn im sure he is
tina mckenzi yeah ive done some work with tom hes a good guy
wn did you do some work with him
tina mckenzi ah well no i just went up to a coupl of time and did some develop day play in one of their australia/ENTITY day/ENTITY tournament with some of the develop girl that they have we did a day camp lead into that went and did a bit of mentor i guess and it was nice to do that with tom that was a long time befor tom i guess tom had just start on the men team back them he was veri passion about improv everyon which he still is
wn watch the glider and the roller with the roller they can do it with the glider much more drama from the glider in london for a time we didnt even know if they were go to make the final lost that game against canada
tina mckenzi yeah that wasnt a great game no it was pretti scari but you know we alway fight back in true glider style seem to be we dont like to take the easi road we like to take the hard road sometim
wn appar
tina mckenzi it been a wellknown thing i dont know whi it is but it just seem to happen that way
wn you said you play over ___ intern game by our count there was ___ befor you went to london plus two game there make ___ intern cap which is more than some team that you play against put togeth
tina mckenzi yeah i thought id be up to near ___ look i think it an amaz thing to have that mani game under your belt and the experi that gain me throughout the year and youv got to be proud about it proud that i stay in there and compet with one of the best team in the world i alway believ that the glider can be the best in the world but
wn you need to prove it
tina mckenzi need to get there just a bit extra
wn befor everi game in london there was an announc that at the world championship and the paralymp they have never won
tina mckenzi no no i rememb ____ in sydney watch the girl play against canada in ____ terribl game yet they were a brilliant team in ____ as well i think the glider have alway had a great team just unfortun that last final game we havent been abl to get over that line yet
wn you were in the final game in ____
tina mckenzi yep never forget that it was an amaz game
wn what was it like
tina mckenzi i think we play our gold medal game against the usa the first game up we knew that we had to beat usa that day that morn it was _am in the morn mayb ___ in the morn and it was one of the earliest game that we play and wed been prepar for this game know that we had to beat usa to make sure that our crossov would be okay and knew that wed sit in a realli good posit against the rest of the team that we would most like play and i think that be my first ever paralymp game it was unforgett i think ill never not forget it the anticip adrenalin and excit and also be a littl bit scare sometim it was realli an amaz game we did play realli realli well we beat america by mayb one point i think that day so we play a tough tough game then we went into the gold medal game i just dont think we had much left in our energi fuel i think it was sort of we knew that we had to get there but we just didnt have enough to get over the line and that was realli unfortun and it was realli sad it was sad that we knew that we could actual beat america but at the end of the day the best team win
wn the best team on the court on the day
tina mckenzi yeah absolut and that can chang ani day it depend where your team at what the etho is like and so it yeah i dont think you can actual say that everi team gonna be on top everi day and it not alway go to be that way im hope the glider will put it all togeth and be abl to take that way through and get that littl gold medal that would be realli nice love to see that happen
wn id like to see that happen id realli like to see them win in toronto appar becaus the canadian men are not in the thing the canadian are go to be focus on their women team they appar didnt take their best team and their men were knock out by columbia or mexico or someth like that
tina mckenzi wow
wn and in the women competit there team like peru but i rememb in london that glider were wrongfoot by brazil a team that they had never face befor near lost that game
tina mckenzi laugh oh yes brazil were an unknown factor to us so they were quit unknown wed done a bit of scout but if youv never play someon befor you get into an unknown situat we knew that theyd be quit similar player to mexico but you know what brazil had a great game they had a brilliant game we didnt have a veri good game at all and it realli hard go into a game that you know that you need to win unbeknown to what all these player can do you can scout them as much as you want but it actual about be on court and play them that make a huge differ i think one of the thing here in australia is that we play each other so often we play against each other so often in the women nation leagu we know exact what i know that shelley/ENTITY chaplin/ENTITY is go to want to go right and close it up and cobi/ENTITY crispin/ENTITY is go to dive underneath the key and do a spin and get the ball so youv actual you know what these player want to do i know that kyli/ENTITY gauci/ENTITY like to doubl screen somewher and shell put it in and it great to have that knowledg of what your player realli like to do when your play with them but go into a team like brazil we knew a coupl of the player what they like to do but we had no idea what their speed was like or what their were go to do who know so it was a bit of an unknown
wn theyll definit be an interest side when it come to rio
tina mckenzi i think theyll be quit good and that happen with china ill alway rememb see china when we were in korea for the first time and go wow these girl can hard move a chair but some of them could shoot and they went from be veri fresh player to go into china as quit a substanti team and then yet again step it up again in london and theyr a good team i think it realli import as not to underestim ani team at a paralymp or at a world cup i mean netherland have done that to us over and over again
wn theyr a tough team too
tina mckenzi theyr a realli tough team and theyr realli unpredict sometim sometim when theyr on theyr on theyr tough theyr realli tough and theyv got a littl bit of hunger in them now like theyr realli hungri to be the top team and you can see that and i rememb see that in germani in beij
wn the german lost to the american in the final in beij
tina mckenzi yes yeah they did
wn and between ____ and ____ all they talk about was the us and a rematch against the us but of cours when it came to london they didnt face the us at all becaus you guy knock the us out of the competit
tina mckenzi yeah we did it was great a great game that
wn you won by a point
tina mckenzi fantast oh my god i came still give me heart palpit
wn it went down to a final shot there was a chanc that the american would win the thing with a shot after the siren well a buzzerbeat
tina mckenzi tough game tough game that whi you go to the paralymp you have those tough nailbit game you hope that at the end of the day that well you alway go in as a player know that youv done whatev you can do
wn thankyou veri much for this
tina mckenzi that alright no problem at all
