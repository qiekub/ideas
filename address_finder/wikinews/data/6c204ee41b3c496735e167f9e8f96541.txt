professor john clark
wikinew what is your role at the univers of buckingham
prof john clark i am professor of modern histori and secretari to council at the univers of buckingham
wn how like do you think it is that these are the remain of king alfr
jc veri difficult to say although as capit of wessex winchest would be the obvious place much would depend on scientif evid see below also need to be check against ani relev literari sourc such as the as chronicl anglosaxon/ENTITY chronicl/ENTITY life/ENTITY of/ENTITY king/ENTITY alfr/ENTITY there is noth i have seen so far that posit exclud identif with alfr i have an idea that there may have been a victorian claim about the burial be that of alfr this make me just a littl suspici the victorian were veri keen on alfr and one cannot rule out the possibl of a fake by an overenthusiast admir with not much els to go on i would say __ per cent
wn is dna test difficult to conduct on bone of such an age would you say that there has been a surg in interest in find the remain of former british monarch
jc royal remain are big news now the alfr stori come up close behind that of richard/ENTITY iii/ENTITY which doe rais the thought of a bandwagon in other word there doe seem to be surg in interest in royal remain an interest combin of rather primit fascin with relic and the complex of scientif analysi the peopl at leicest are certain that the bone they have are richard iii and i have no reason to question their find in the case of alfr there are three obvious differ
richard iii burial was some ___ year ago wherea alfr was about ____ year ago other thing be equal and i do not know anyth about the condit of the bone it is like to be harder to make posit identif for human materi that is more than twice as old as richard
again i must stress that i am not an archaeologist or dna person but my understand is that in richard iii case procedur centr on comparison between his dna and that of peopl who are aliv today and who are descend from other member of his famili includ his brother the duke/ENTITY of/ENTITY clarenc/ENTITY and his niec elizabeth/ENTITY of/ENTITY york/ENTITY i was struck by how mani figur of import today are relat to richard in other word they are the sort of peopl whose famili tree are well known while i am sure that there are mani peopl relat to alfr the greater length of time and the dispossess of so mani saxon at the time of the norman conquest would mean that present day descend would be harder to trace with certainti in other word i do not say that the dna method would be imposs but it would face much bigger challeng than in the case of richard iii
one of the clinch factor with richard iii was that contemporari account describ the king as have a hump back as did the skeleton as far as i know alfr did not have ani unusu physic featur
