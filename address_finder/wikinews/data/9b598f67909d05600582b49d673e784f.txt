saturday april __ ____ annual carbon dioxid emiss broken down into differ fuel type dure ________ ad
this week the public/ENTITY broadcast/ENTITY servic/ENTITY air a program titl dim the earth which present research by lead scientist on the complex system of our global climat and human activ effect on it one of the largest interact or input human have with the atmospher is the everincreas use of fossil/ENTITY fuel/ENTITY consumpt has risen _ per year for this decad
fossil fuel burnt in factori and automobil send their wast into our atmospher in two form the first is and other greenhous/ENTITY gase/ENTITY which have receiv substanti attent in the last few year becaus of the way they trap heat in the atmospher the second is the tini particl of sulfur dioxid soot and ash which scientist call basic smog research into understand the negat health effect of air pollut has result in the develop of catalyt/ENTITY convert/ENTITY for car as well as devic to remov particul solid from industri wast befor it reach the air
more recent atmospher scientist have come upon the phenomenon of the reduct of direct sunlight reach earth surfac observ a near a _ declin between ____ and ____ with evid of a recoveri sinc then this has been dub the global/ENTITY dim/ENTITY effect and is probabl due to the way these aerosol act upon cloud it is import to realis that this doe not repres a net loss of this much sunshin to the climat system if so larg temperatur declin would have been observ instead the sunshin is absorb elsewher in the system with a much smaller net loss a nasa photograph show aircraft contrail and natur cloud taken from i__ in northern virginia januari __ ____ by nasa scientist loui nguyen form when moistur gather around airborn particl such as pollen or dust cloud form by the aerosol particl emit by fossil fuel consumpt are made of mani more tini droplet than natur cloud these smogcreat cloud have two notabl effect they shield sunlight from reach earth surfac and due to water reflect natur the million of tini droplet suspend in them reflect light back into space allow even less light to reach earth
mani scientist now believ that global dim caus by these pollut has mitig the temperatur rise brought about by global/ENTITY warm/ENTITY over the last thirti year earth temperatur has increas by about __ oc
in the absenc of global dim howev the earth might be __ oc warmer than it current is suggest that a tugofwar exist between greenhous gase and particul releas by burn fossil fuel effort to mitig the human health danger of smog have allow more heat into our atmospher and brought about a sharper increas in global warm
dr jame e hansen professor at columbia univers and the head of the goddard institut for space studi believ that if we continu on our current pattern this warm could be as much as five degre in the next thirti year and ten to fourteen degre over the cours of the centuri such a temperatur rise would devast life on earth like bring on a cascad of selfreinforc warm effect earth forest dri and burn a steadi thaw of the arctic/ENTITY ice/ENTITY sheet/ENTITY and most danger of all a releas of the methan/ENTITY hydrat/ENTITY that are now frozen at the bottom of the ocean could remak the planet into someth inhospit to human life dr hansen warn that accord to his research man has just __ year to reduc greenhous gase befor global warm and other respons to human activ by earth climat reach a tip point becom unstopp
