friday novemb __ ____
two research articl publish this week illustr continu effort to predict earthquak the first articl build upon the idea that analysi of the first seismic/ENTITY wave/ENTITY from an earthquak can provid a way to generat a sever second warn that an earthquak will hit howev for such warn to be use the earli seismic wave should also allow predict of the strength of the earthquak an articl publish in this week edit of conclud that scientist might be abl to distinguish small earthquak from big one by use the veri first second of inform contain in seismic wave the frequenc of p wave may allow predict of the strength of earthquak
research from the univers of california berkeley say the measur of seismic wave soon after a trembler can signal whether it will be a minor or monster trembler basic a highpitch squeal mean that youll get a smaller quak a lowgroan mean someth bigger say the univers of california richard allen
in the studi allen and colleagu analyz record of __ major pacif rim quak in the past decad includ __ event that were greater than a magnitud _ use a mathemat model they were abl to estim a quak size to within one magnitud unit from as littl as four second of data of the frequenc of the energi in the primari wave these lowenergi wave typic caus a jolt signal the occurr of a quak
accord to a tradit theori call the cascad model we cannot know anyth about an earthquak ultim magnitud until it is finish this is becaus spread along a fault line depend on the stress in each individu part of the fault given that this inform is not avail to the initi ruptur point it should be imposs to tell from that first slip how far it will go or how long it will last
the studi by berkeley allen and erik l olson of the univers of wisconsinmadison build upon earlier work by yutaka nakamura in japan nakamura research indic that the frequenc of the p/ENTITY wave/ENTITY can allow predict of which earthquak will have a magnitud greater than _ and distinguish them from small tremor that do not requir warn some fire station use p wave detector to automat open door in an effort to make sure that emerg vehicl are not trap insid by door that can be jam shut by earthquak damag
the goal of this research is to make the best possibl use of the inform from the earliest seismic wave emit by an earthquak as part of an alert system to give second to ten of second of advanc notic of an impend quak enough time for schoolchildren to take cover power generat to trip off and valv to shut on pipelin a major limit of this work is that the greatest earthquak damag is near the epicent where there is littl time differ between the earli p wave and the strongest damag earthquak wave
the second research paper publish this week in the scientif magazin physic/ENTITY review/ENTITY letter/ENTITY build upon earlier research into pattern of earthquak activ at specif fault the new research by scientist from israel and germani led by prof shlomo havlin of barilan univers depart of physic in israel concern predict of the time between earthquak
prof havlin research in collabor with prof armin bund of the justusliebig univers in giessen germani and barilan univers graduat student valeri livina involv a larg number of past earthquak at mani differ fault the data use in this studi were for earthquak rang from magnitud _ to magnitud __ on the richter/ENTITY scale/ENTITY data were from sever area of the world includ california japan and new zealand the new result are consist with previous studi which have indic that some fault have more frequent small earthquak while other fault have less frequent and larger earthquak
