in the trial t cell were remov from each patient and modifi in the laboratori patient underw chemotherapi to kill most of their current immun system which was replac by the cell the modifi cell success surviv after inject into the bodi make up __ of the subject t cell count dure the first _ month the team is now look for way to enabl the cell to surviv longer and in greater number
