amanda carter and that the thing we just decid that if he had come it would have been harder for him know hed have five minut a day or twenti minut or someth like that where he could see me versus he spoke to me for an hour on skype everi day so i think it would have been harder to say to alex look you cant come back to the villag you need to go with my friend now and stuff like that so he made the decis that he want to stay and have his normal routin of school activ and just talk to mum on skype everi day
wn fair enough
