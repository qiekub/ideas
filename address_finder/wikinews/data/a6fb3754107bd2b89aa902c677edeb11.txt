amid recent rumor and news on the progress to find the higg boson a disput has arisen as to who should get credit for the discoveri and the result nobel/ENTITY prize/ENTITY in/ENTITY physic/ENTITY ____ jj sakurai prize winner kibbl guralnik hagen englert and brout peter higg was not present
six peopl across three differ team are credit with this discoveri robert/ENTITY brout/ENTITY françoi/ENTITY englert/ENTITY of the université/ENTITY libr/ENTITY de/ENTITY bruxell/ENTITY peter/ENTITY higg/ENTITY univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY edinburgh/ENTITY g/ENTITY s/ENTITY guralnik/ENTITY brown/ENTITY univers/ENTITY c/ENTITY r/ENTITY hagen/ENTITY of the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY rochest/ENTITY tom/ENTITY kibbl/ENTITY imperi/ENTITY colleg/ENTITY london/ENTITY three paper written in ____ explain what is now known as the englertbrouthiggsguralnikhagenkibbl mechan or higg/ENTITY mechan/ENTITY higg/ENTITY boson/ENTITY for short the mechan is the key element of the electroweak theori that form part of the standard/ENTITY model/ENTITY of particl physic the paper that introduc this mechan were publish in physic/ENTITY review/ENTITY letter/ENTITY in ____ and were each recogn as mileston paper by prls __th anniversari celebr
there are six peopl who develop the mechan in quick success and who hold a legitim claim to credit for it say particl physicist frank/ENTITY close/ENTITY at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY oxford/ENTITY uk becaus the swedish/ENTITY royal/ENTITY academi/ENTITY of/ENTITY scienc/ENTITY can award nobel prize to no more than three peopl this put six men aim for half as mani nobel medal should the particl be found the nobel committe can award the prize to group and associ and the larg/ENTITY hadron/ENTITY collid/ENTITY are search for a particl that will constitut evid for this signific discoveri recent progress has given a new urgenc not onli to the race to find the particl but also to establish authorship of the idea behind it as john/ENTITY elli/ENTITY a particl physicist base at cern acknowledg let face it a nobel/ENTITY prize/ENTITY is at stake
the issu over credit and authorship was highlight late juli in franc when the american and british team of were omit from the confer overview web site sever group threaten to boycott and rais the issu in discuss of the theori behind the ongo search for the particl one of the meet organ gregorio bernardi at the laboratori of nuclear and high energi physic in pari admit that the committe was surpris by the strength of object level at the web advertis and the committe peopl took this veri serious which we didnt expect he say
physicist tom ferbel said the snub by the french confer organ was insult and chill note that the american/ENTITY physic/ENTITY societi/ENTITY award the ____ j/ENTITY j/ENTITY sakurai/ENTITY prize/ENTITY for/ENTITY theoret/ENTITY particl/ENTITY physic/ENTITY to all six physicist for this theori i do fear he said that the myopic view of the organ could definit impact the decis of the swedish/ENTITY academi/ENTITY the confer organ acknowledg that their choic was controversi by invit a special talk on the tangl histori of the mechan provid a forum for disgruntl confer particip to debat the matter howev although the meet ultim ran smooth it seem like that argument over this issu will becom more heat now that the higg particl is perceiv to be within reach as john/ENTITY elli/ENTITY state im just glad that im not on the nobel committe decid who to throw out of the lifeboat
