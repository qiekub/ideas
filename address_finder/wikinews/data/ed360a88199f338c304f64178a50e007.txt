wn thompson okay just a few more question you had mention earlier about the role that congressman dan burton had play in your life could you pleas talk a littl bit more about that
md well certain he is somebodi that was my boss ive known him for a good chunk of my life when i was thirteen or fourteen i serv as a page for him when he was an indiana state senat i had volunt a littl bit on his polit campaign but not a great deal primarili put sticker on fire hat in prepar for his parad season
but i work for him from i want to say ____ to ____ rough eight year give or take i serv as a member of his profession staff when he was chairman of the hous committe on govern reform and oversight and then i also serv as a member of his profession staff handl a number of differ polici area includ foreign polici and nation secur polici i cover agricultur issu and environment polici forum given some of my academ background but primarili in the nation secur foreign polici area primarili focus on antinarcot and the drug war i was abl to travel in addit to travel when i was an intern elect observ i was abl to travel as a member of his staff to countri like when i was in colombia i got to watch an erad mission of coca and poppi field down in colombia i also got to work on other case there was a new tribe and missionari case that i work on where there were three men who were abduct by the and there was no proof of life and they just basic disappear and i was abl to work with the famili and other in leadership within the to bring that whole issu to closur they eventu declar the missionari as be kill by the farc but as you can imagin it was one of those thing where the famili was in limbo and they just did not know and nobodi was tri to find out for them
it was a great honor to work as a staff member for congressman burton probabl one of the most thank point in my time for him was when i help write or help ghost write the resolut honor the life of mother/ENTITY theresa/ENTITY which was adopt by the congress you all probabl dont rememb but mother theresa die right around the time that princess/ENTITY diana/ENTITY die and all of the news coverag at the time was dedic toward princess diana and mother theresa is arguabl somebodi that had live more of a christlik life than anybodi sinc jesus/ENTITY christ/ENTITY wn thompson okay one last question from me what was your father and mother relationship with former congressman dan burton
md they went to high school togeth and knew him from their time in high school and my mother specif was involv with the young/ENTITY republican/ENTITY when congressman burton was involv with the young republican and they all kind of grew up in polit togeth and then she later becam a volunt for his campaign
wn jordan mornout you end up lose your first campaign when you sought the nomin for indiana secretari/ENTITY of/ENTITY state/ENTITY in ____ of cours your oppon that year were impress but can you tell us from your perspect about the dramat finish to that nomin
md that is a veri sore subject with me but it not as sore as it use to be it interest becaus you guy realli i was kind of surpris with the captur of the whole flyer deal on the floor which misl the convent to think that i had will drop out of the race and my strategi was to win it on the second ballot i was everybodi second choic the peopl that were support todd/ENTITY rokita/ENTITY were support him becaus of their relationship with sue ann gilroy and they would support me if todd was not in the race the peopl that were support richard/ENTITY mourdock/ENTITY were support him becaus he was older and had more experi than i had but they like me after they got to know me and i was their second choic
and so i had liter campaign in all __ counti for two year of my life drive around the state of indiana in my americanmad honda/ENTITY civic/ENTITY which becam a polit issu for part of the race dure that race congressman luke/ENTITY messer/ENTITY was part of the field for a time diana cordray the clerk treasur at carmel was in part of the field for a time kent/ENTITY benson/ENTITY was a big part of it campaign against him was like campaign against elvi/ENTITY presley/ENTITY becaus wed go to these southern indiana counti and he would autograph basketbal with the start five in the ____ indiana univers nation/ENTITY championship/ENTITY team and that was the time that i said i had to do someth becaus he was kill me polit and so we start put our name on peanut butter and pass out peanut butter we said that if peanut were the food of eleph then peanut butter was the food of the grassroot of the republican parti whose symbol was the eleph
so we we ran hard we ran a strong campaign and realli it was that campaign that creat the foundat for my abil to becom a senat but there no question that that was a hardfought campaign and the way that it end was less than favor liter the next day i had to get on an airplan to fli to camp/ENTITY shelbi/ENTITY to do my _ week of armi train in the middl of nowher and i rememb be on a rifl rang and a there was misfir happen and i look up to the safeti offic on the rifl rang and i said was that richard mourdock over there obvious they didnt get the joke but richard and i are now friend and get along great
wn tew and in fact you were both compet for senat/ENTITY richard/ENTITY lugar/ENTITY s offic
md well your talk about the unit state senat this last go round
wn yes
md yeah at the time i was finish up my legal studi and kind of transit profession i was run my own homebas busi call ma advisori group which was base upon my grandfath name of his compani the ma delph compani which i mention befor and i had thought about that for a littl bit i had been approach by some folk out in washington dc specif that i have known for year and that had an interest in me consid that and it realli wasnt a good time for me profession and in the life of my famili and so it wasnt someth that i ever form a committe or rais money or start campaign or reach out to peopl to build support but it did get in the press
that led to richard mourdock reach out to me we had lunch we talk about the opportun and he candid ask me what i thought the top issu were and i told him and a lot of what i said he end up use as part of his platform to run against senat lugar and he ultim was success while that whole thing was go on my wife and i took a threeweek home school trip out to the east coast to visit former revolutionari/ENTITY war/ENTITY histor site to learn more about the found of the countri
it mistaken in percept that i have some type of disregard for senat lugar i have veri high regard for him and his leadership and specif his public servic anybodi that serv that long sacrific a great deal with their famili and in their busi financi to serv the public so i have a tremend regard for him person and profession i just had strong reserv and disagr with him in matter of public polici and in the direct of some of the issu he was campaign out in the unit state senat but there no question that he was a strong figur in washington dc
wn tew let paus for a brief identif
interview part ii controversi over the propos marriag amend
wn chad tew this is wikinew it is march __ ____ and we are here in the radio studio of the edg speak to indiana state senat mike delph by telephon here with our next question is justin law
wn law senat delph your opposit to samesex marriag and your public express of love for your brother stephen has us wonder about how you reconcil what seem to some as contradictori stanc could you explain to us your philosoph stand on homosexu and support of tradit marriag
mike delph sure i come to my support of all of the tradit famili valu from my christian convict and my belief in the authent and reliabl of the bibl my faith tradit teach me that is one in a number of sin that list out in the bibl and so that whi i have an opposit to anyth that institution or legitim a given sin
the reconcili of the contradict that you point out is realli love the sinner hate the sin type deal you know my brother stephen is my older brother hes had a veri tough life and weve been through a lot togeth and you cant go through life togeth and experi thing as a famili unit we just experienc for exampl last year the death of my father and the death of my grandmoth both of whom were close to each one of us that was someth that we went through togeth you cant go through life and go through experi with thing like that without have love for one anoth a love as brother and so i do love my brother i support my brother i support his right to be a human be as well as i do all human be and to live his life and i dont tell him how to live his life and i dont tell him what to do or where to go or who to be friend with i feel like i respect my brother but i dont as ive mention to the media befor i dont support the lifestyl of homosexu becaus it is contrari to my christian convict
wn tew senat your brother said on the air that you had set him up on a date and you deni that could you just briefli talk about this
md certain ive never set my brother up with anybodi nor have i done anyth ever to promot his gay lifestyl i have friend that i went to colleg with that i have suggest could be friend with my brother sever of my brother quit candid and in this case i had a friend from colleg who at the time had recent told me that he was gay and my brother i think mistaken made the connect that by me introduc him to a friend of mine who is gay that somehow there was more to it than that my brother stephen is not use to talk to the media and know that he misspok when he made that character i love my brother and we have reconcil that misstat but never in my lifetim have i done anyth to go contrari to that christian convict and that belief that i have on that lifestyl
wn bobbi shipman senat delph this is bobbi speak now hjr_ the propos constitut amend that would have ban samesex marriag and civil union you said it was the best environ right now whi is this the right time for hjr_
md well in order for a constitut amend to be adopt you have it to go to a legisl bodi pass the hous and senat then you have to have an elect and you have to have the new legisl bodi take up the exact same languag and pass the hous and senat and so from a procedur standpoint if it didnt pass in the same form this time the clock get reset and the process start over
when i survey my constitu and i do an annual legisl survey over __ percent of my survey respons suggest that peopl want the opportun to vote on this issu via referendum this year novemb of ____ they did not indic which way they would vote so they could have said we want to vote on it becaus we want to reject it and we want to be done with it this year or they could have said we want to adopt it into our constitut either way becaus of the action of the leadership of the hous and the senat my constitu were deni that opportun to vote and resolv this issu onc and for all in novemb ____ and when i engag in this issu the one thing i heard from peopl across the spectrum on hjr_ is they want the legislatur to be done with this onc and for all
and when i went through in my mind the differ cours of action that could get us there i kept come back to the referendum and i did not see anoth way that we could bring final closur and resolut to this issu this veri sensit and difficult issu without pass it to the peopl for an up or down vote becaus of the path that we chose there is go to be pressur to bring this back next year and possibl year beyond that so the state of indiana is go to be forc to deal with this issu year in and year out which is my fear
wn shipman with the poll in indiana show a chang in public opinion over the past sever year that is more favor/ENTITY to/ENTITY the/ENTITY accept/ENTITY of/ENTITY samesex/ENTITY marriag/ENTITY do you think it go to be harder to support tradit marriag in the futur
md well not for me becaus i am who i am and i support what i support and i support tradit and judeochristian valu i think if the poll data is accur as you express it then the folk that were the oppon of hjr_ specif the folk that were in leadership within freedom indiana were work against their own selfinterest whi do i say that well if public opinion has truli chang then it was in their interest to pass this through the legislatur and send it to the peopl themselv for an up or down vote were the referendum would be defeat and the issu would forev be gone and dealt with and so i think there is some disput where public opinion is this is a veri sensit issu it divid famili it divid polit parti it divid neighbor obvious you know about my famili and there is a differ of opinion just with me and brother on this issu there a differ between me and my mother on this opinion there even a differ of opinion in the delph household in the hous where i live and so these are all thing that our state and societi have to reconcil but to me the ultim issu was bring this whole thing to closur and by deni peopl the right to vote this novemb we did not bring this to closur
wn shipman sinc the amend would have had a long last consequ on didnt the process work this time
md well some could say that if that bring the issu to final closur but have sat in the legislatur now for eight year i think there go to be pressur to bring this back this next session some sort of version and it may be amend to make it tougher they may put the civil union ban back in it which then put it on anoth two year and so for me i dont think the inform is go to be ani clearer i dont think the issu are go to be ani better understood to me it didnt make ani sens to delay the final resolut of this onc and for all and for me again the onli way that i could see us bring this to final closur was to have the referendum by the public and if public opinion has chang then those that support samesex marriag work against their own selfinterest by deni the peopl the right to vote on this in novemb of ____ becaus if they would have allow the vote and public opinion had chang then they probabl would have vote the referendum down and that would have been the debat onc and for all
wn tew but there is also the suprem/ENTITY court/ENTITY that the legislatur would have to deal with ani kind of decis that made between now and when they act next
md certain there is a coupl of thing at play there recent i think in they stuck down and then stay the decis the michigan constitut/ENTITY amend/ENTITY so there is no question that the feder court are get involv there is equal/ENTITY protect/ENTITY ground/ENTITY litig that is be file throughout the countri and specif in indiana i think there has been four law suit file challeng the indiana statut which has been on the book sinc ____ and so this is a big battl that go on legal
tradit the wide held view is that the us/ENTITY constitut/ENTITY trump the state/ENTITY constitut/ENTITY and that feder/ENTITY decis/ENTITY in court trump state constitut law and so those are all thing that have to be reconcil with the public opinion and with the will of the peopl and what they want and how they view their govern and how they want societi to react and deal with these type of issu
but there is no question that even if we would have pass the constitut amend and even if the public would have adopt it that that did not prevent a court challeng in feder court
let me just make one more comment to me though we cannot as a legisl bodi at the state level of govern live in fear of litig we have an articl/ENTITY _/ENTITY oath of offic that we take to the us/ENTITY constitut/ENTITY that bind all elect offici to the same rule/ENTITY of/ENTITY law/ENTITY except the presid/ENTITY of/ENTITY the/ENTITY unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY who take a separ oath of offic and that oath of offic is to the written constitut as written in the constitut it has noth to do with common law has noth to do with suprem court decis and stare decisi it has to do with the written law the written constitut we also take an oath to uphold the indiana/ENTITY state/ENTITY constitut/ENTITY and that oath of offic is someth i take veri veri serious and that is what should drive us our own understand of the constitut not ani fear of litig in feder court
wn devyn curri can you briefli give us your version of the chronolog from the time you made the tweet heard around the world to the time when you were punish for the tweet
md i will tri to do the best that i can you know the ironi in all of this is that hjr_ was realli not my issu i had found through interact with the governor staff that the governor mike/ENTITY penc/ENTITY was pretti displeas with what was go on the legislatur particular in the hous of repres he could not understand how a super major hous and a super major senat could not get this issu to the voter he spoke in favor of hjr_ and in a state of the state address and then in an addit followup interview with polit report jim shella wishtv is at channel _ our cbs/ENTITY news/ENTITY affili in indianapoli and so i was tri to help them behind the scene i work with senat/ENTITY denni/ENTITY kruse/ENTITY who had told me that senat david long had want to control that process and have senat mike/ENTITY young/ENTITY introduc the amend on the floor that would restor the second sentenc so that we could adopt the entir amend and send it to the voter
for me though if you go back and look at my press confer i pretti method laid out the chronolog of whi i thought that senat long and other had taken the issu into their own hand in order to realli kill the issu for the session and when i had met with them befor learn the concern of the governor i had met with senat long and senat brent/ENTITY steel/ENTITY and we were ask becaus we were member of the judiciari committe to do a whip count on the judiciari member to find out if there was support to reinsert the second sentenc and if there was support to pass hjr_ to pass out of the committe at the time we were told that the resolut was go to go to judiciari committe and then when we did the whip count we found support to restor the second sentenc and then pass it out of committe after that senat long made the decis to not send it to judiciari but rather to his own committe rule committe and then he made the further decis that he wasnt go to allow ani amend and then he was go to pass the resolut to the floor without amend which if you look at the number the mathemat and again i go through all of this in my press confer which is on in detail if you take the thirteen democrat and assum that they are all go to vote no it onli take thirteen more republican to vote no with the democrat and so the mathemat work against conserv republican on the senat floor and i think all those thing in addit to other thing factor into senat long decis to do what he did
now in term of the tweet when i was tri to help senat kruse i had start my own whip count and i was stuck on fifteen solid republican vote to agre on the floor to reinsert the second sentenc well i need twentysix if i didnt have twentysix it wasnt go to happen becaus of the math with the democrat
and so we had caucus i cant tell you what was discuss or said or done in caucus but becaus i had file my amend becaus at the time i wasnt posit that an amend was go to be file in check with the legisl servic agenc and with the senat major attorney offic i went ahead and file an amend to make sure that we would meet a deadlin so an amend could be file i did that know that i was stuck at fifteen vote and so there was media interest as to whether or not i was go to call my amend and what was go to happen we were on the senat floor and this was after the caucus meet within minut of denni kruse call hjr_ for second read and that when i put out the tweet say there wasnt support for me to call my amend and that the second sentenc was dead for the session of the general assembl
when i did that i did that to satisfi inquiri from probabl over half a dozen differ media outlet that were go to ask me or had ask me what i was go to do rather than have the same discuss six to ten differ time i just want to handl it at onc dure but what i didnt anticip at the time was that everybodi under the sun would retweet that tweet and i would start to trend nation at that point this evolv into a whole other level of newsworthi
senat long came back on the floor and ask me about it and i explain what i did and whi at the time i thought thing were resolv between the two of us it was onli later that he had a media avail and he kind of blast me and accus me of leak a caucus confid that we realli start to get into it within the press
and at that point in time i made the decis to hold my news confer and to vote against hjr_ if he would not allow the second sentenc to be restor i did that for a coupl of reason one of which was i had pass out a legal memorandum from a veri reput sourc out of washington dc that had told us that without the second sentenc our amend had no legal consequ so we were basic pass a statement that had no legal signific and for me given how divis this was and how drain it was in term of energi and what not it didnt make ani sens to me to pass someth for polit purpos that wasnt go to have ani legal consequ
and again i talk about all of that in my press confer on youtub if you havent seen it it will take thirti minut of your life to watch it it was carri live on channel/ENTITY _/ENTITY news affili in indianapoli and i walk through method the chronolog of event at that press confer
wn curri what were you tri to convey to the public through the media at the press confer
md i was tri to bring to light what was go on with the process and i was tri to bring to light my reason and think as to whi i felt like this was a set up job from the begin and that there was no intent to get this to the peopl and how senat long had control the process and how everi step of the process the decis that he made gave evid to what i was say that the peopl were never go to see this amend at the ballot box in novemb of ____ i also felt like it was newsworthi that one of the most conserv member of the indiana state senat was go to vote against the marriag amend becaus it had no legal consequ i want to explain to the public and to my constitu whi a guy that is a strong support of tradit judeochristian valu was not go to support the marriag amend becaus i didnt believ that the marriag amend had legal consequ
wn curri senat did you violat caucus rule of secreci
md i did not
and the say that i take great great umbrag with is the onli way i can fulli defend myself would be to go violat caucus protocol and confid
now i dont accus senat long of lie that is a littl strong there are some becaus what has been said to the media particular by senat long that have had the wrong percept that i may have violat a confid of the caucus i certain want to clear up ani kind of misunderstand with my caucus mate but in no way did i violat a caucus confid the tweet that i put out was base upon my own inform from my own whip count that i kept on this project senat scott/ENTITY schneider/ENTITY knew about my whip count senat denni kruse knew about my whip count senat mike young knew about my whip count and so this idea that i violat a caucus confid is unfortun it wrong it untru it mislead and hope this will help correct that record
wn senat chad tew here who leak the inform about your punish to the media
md that is a great question becaus laugh there is anoth issu over in the hous of repres about caucus confid be violat i dont know if you are follow that with the whole nurs moratorium issu
but it was interest becaus the follow thursday i was call in to senat long and there were a coupl of other senat and they brought me in there to tell me what my consequ from this whole event was go to be and they list out four differ thing that were go to happen and they then told me they were go to go to the caucus and privat tell them what was go to happen well i get home thursday night that night get readi to have dinner and i get a call from a channel __ nbc/ENTITY news/ENTITY affili and they say senat delph we understand this this this and this are go to happen to you becaus of violat caucus protocol do you have a comment
and i just find it grossli hypocrit and somewhat iron that there would be a violat of caucus protocol to leak out this punish that i have while theyr accus me of this it realli all veri silli
sinc i have been in the legislatur for eight year i have been a champion of transpar and account and i think the public has the right to know what their elect offici are do on behalf of them and in some case against them and in this case i did not violat a caucus confid and i was tri to advoc for my constitu who want the right to vote on this issu as reflect in the survey that they return to my offic and so i felt like i was do thing to tri to advoc on their behalf without necessarili take a posit from their perspect on whether they felt like this should be part of the constitut or not part of the constitut i was tri to give them their opportun which they said they want to vote on this one way or the other
wn tew concern your punish youv had a number of disagr over the year with senat leader david long doe senat leader david long serv the republican in the state senat or do they serv him
md yeah that is a great question i like senat long he and i everi coupl of year will have an issu the legisl process is not one where conflict can be avoid when you are in the arena you are go to have issu and i have enjoy serv with senat long but ultim we the peopl elect elect offici to serv in the legisl branch of govern and as thoma/ENTITY jefferson/ENTITY said the consent/ENTITY of/ENTITY the/ENTITY govern/ENTITY are who give and what give elect leadership and legislatur the legitimaci to make decis on behalf of the peopl and so senat long has been elect by the republican caucus to a posit of great public trust to manag the institut integr of the senat and so he need to in my opinion i have said this to him public and privat to rememb it is the peopl of indiana that he repres and not just special interest or even the interest of the caucus itself but it is the public at larg and he has also a respons to the institut of the senat

mike delph thank for have me professor one thing i just want to add from the last segment there are a lot of youtub video and interview that ive done and ive tri to be consist in the stori that ive been tell make sure that the truth get communic to the public but when i did my press confer i veri method walk through my reason for whi i believ that the marriag amend was at least on the senat side set up for failur from the begin and i also address the whole tweet and where the inform for that tweet came from there been misinform and mispercept that it was tweet from a caucus meet that is a falsehood it was a tweet that i actual put out again direct from the senat floor within minut of hjr_ be call down for a second read and i did that again becaus there were a number of media request to explain what i was go to do or not do with the amend i had file to restor the second sentenc i would encourag your listen and your student if theyv not done so to go listen to the press confer on youtub
wn rachel christian senat delph you have been label as a social conserv where do you believ you fall on the polit spectrum
md you know that a good question in my intro wikipedia voic intro project that i read for wikinew for the project that the professor and i work on togeth i refer myself as a fiscal and social conserv
i kind of consid myself a constitut conserv i consid myself veri independentmind if you look at my last elect in ____ i won my senat district __ percent to __ percent just two year prior to that presid barack/ENTITY obama/ENTITY won the same senat district __ percent to __ percent over john/ENTITY mccain/ENTITY so i think my histori has shown an abil to have peopl who arent necessarili conserv republican voter vote for me

so i do consid myself a fullspectrum conserv fiscal and social but more import i consid myself a constitut conserv
wn bradi gray recent polit comment brian howey wrote about your senat district is it fair to say that your district is not social conserv that your stand on hjr_ might not been align with your constitu and that the democrat see your seat as an opportun
md well you will to talk to the democrat parti about what they see as an opportun i cant speak for them
i will tell you again i survey my constitu everi year befor we go in session and i knew that the marriag amend was go to be someth that was go to be debat and consid i ask them if they want a chanc to vote on this through the constitut amend process via referendum in novemb ____ i sent that survey to all regist voter in senat district __ and over __ percent of the respond said they want a chanc to vote in novemb ____ again i didnt ask which way they were go to vote whether they were go to vote yes or no but rather did they want the chanc to vote my posit primarili was driven by that piec of inform and my desir to tri to advoc on behalf of my constitu to bring this whole issu to resolut
from a person standpoint this issu is veri divis the media is fixat on it veri littl els was cover becaus the media was so fixat on it and to me whether you were for the amend or against the amend there was pretti strong support to be done with it onc and for all and i couldnt figur out a way to bring final closur to this without go to the referendum process to the public and so i was hope we could deal with this whole issu in ____ but other felt differ that were in the leadership and so we are go to be deal with this issu on into the futur
in term of the ideolog of my constitu i have some constitu who are social conserv i have some constitu who are social moder i have some constitu who are social liber the proof is go to be in/ENTITY the/ENTITY pud/ENTITY when we run for reelect in novemb ____ whether or not this is the drive issu to drive turnout and ultim render judgement over the total of my servic in the senat
last year i carri three bill into law ive been known wide as somebodi who is a leader on veteran and militari issu last year we expand contract opportun for veteran return from iraqi/ENTITY freedom/ENTITY endur/ENTITY freedom/ENTITY i wrote and carri into law a strong reform in the area of educ for high perform school i have led effort in reform for local govern reform in titl __ of indiana code i have been name legisl of the year by the disabl/ENTITY american/ENTITY veteran/ENTITY and i have been give the distinguish public servic award twice onc in ____ and onc in ____ by the american/ENTITY legion/ENTITY ive been award the mr clean award by common/ENTITY caus/ENTITY for my effort to promot lobbi reform and ethic reform and redistrict reform ive led an effort to chang the law in the area immigr reform and again that was not a republican or democrat issu it was an american patriot issu and a lot of my folk that were not a conserv or republican becaus of my leadership on this issu support me in ____ we feel veri good about where we were polit
i just actual just had a grassroot campaign committe with my team on saturday at my hous my __yearold daughter abbi who is a freshman at iupui is go to serv as my campaign manag and im go to teach her how to do this we have the leader of the colleg/ENTITY republican/ENTITY anderson/ENTITY univers/ENTITY as well as iupui and other leader from butler/ENTITY univers/ENTITY that will all be involv in my grass root effort
befor thanksgiv there was some talk that somebodi might tri to challeng me in a primari and our grassroot effort we had home/ENTITY school/ENTITY mom and volunt make over ____ phone call to base republican voter we shut that down pretti quick we have the strongest best grassroot team in the state senat i welcom competit we are go to go out and compet and we are go to let the voter make their decis we feel veri good where we are polit
from a campaign financ standpoint we have the most money that we have ever had we have ______ in cash in the bank i have a busi man a christian pastor who has offer to write a check for _____ to support me anoth person is go to write a check for ____ and i suspect if i realli tri to rais more money i could rais a lot more money
so again i feel the grassroot the financi support the communiti support will be there for us but ultim i serv at the pleasur of the voter and if they choos that they would rather have somebodi els serv them and repres them in the indiana state senat i certain will respect that decis but i will never shi away from my core convict or my christian principl or what i believ in or what i think the right thing to do is and i will alway act on what i believ is the right thing to do
wn casi mathi senat this is casi how import are the busi or establish republican in your district and do you stand in danger of alien them with your stand on hjr_
md you know there are some busi that are in fear of litig right now becaus of the whole environ around samesex/ENTITY marriag/ENTITY there are some church that will be su and possibl forc to ordain a relationship and a union that their god reject and so there are some busi that will probabl have some concern but there will be other busi that will support my posit i think most busi though arent realli motiv by this issu in particular they are just out tri to run a busi to make payrol to grow their busi and ive got a strong businessfriend record as delin by the indiana chamber/ENTITY of/ENTITY commerc/ENTITY and the indiana manufactur/ENTITY associ/ENTITY a strong histori for promot econom growth includ our latest bill this year was senat bill _ where weve given the local govern unit the abil to phase out the busi person properti tax if they so choos to do so and a gradual further reduct of the corpor incom tax
one other addit point i want to make ive also been a leader on corpor transpar reform last year i also carri into law a bill that governor sign into law befor a board of director meet of the indiana/ENTITY econom/ENTITY develop/ENTITY corpor/ENTITY call for and requir more transpar and the econom incent that we give out to compani that say that they are go to creat x amount of job in exchang for those econom incent so bottom line i think my record in the senat has been veri probusi and projob growth and proeconom develop and so i think busi will look more at that than they will look at hjr_
wn sean kerchief your like oppon in next fall elect jd ford say he stand for quot equal do you
md ive not had a chanc to meet mr ford i look forward to do so you know we still have a primari to get through and ill probabl reserv my comment until after may after the candid have been offici nomin by the voter of each parti but i believ in equal we do have equal of marriag we just have not ever believ as a societi that that translat to samesex marriag we have had over two hundr year of social norm and of stand up for tradit judeochristian valu and this idea of equat samesex marriag with opposit sex or tradit marriag is a veri new thing in the histori and life of indiana and our nation and so ani man has the right to marri a woman who agre to marri him and ani woman has the right to marri ani man who agre to marri her and that is equal you know across all boundari
wn keisha wright senat delph what are the polit stand that are go to provid the sharpest contrast between you and your like polit oppon jd ford this fall
