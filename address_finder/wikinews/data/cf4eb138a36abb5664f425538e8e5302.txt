friday march __ ____ heat radiat from the entir length of ___ kilomet __ milelong fractur is seen in this bestyet heat map of the activ south polar region of saturn ice moon enceladus spacecraft has discov organ materi and water spew from a geyser on one of s moon accord to the discoveri was made when cassini flew by the moon on march __
a complet unexpect surpris is that the of enceladus what come out from insid resembl that of a to have primordi materi come out from insid a saturn moon rais mani question on the format of the saturn system said hunter wait princip investig for the cassini ion and neutral mass spectromet at the southwest/ENTITY research/ENTITY institut/ENTITY locat in san/ENTITY antonio/ENTITY the ion and neutral mass spectromet saw a much higher densiti of volatil gase water vapor carbon/ENTITY dioxid/ENTITY carbon/ENTITY monoxid/ENTITY as well as organ materi some __ time denser than expect this dramat increas in densiti was evid as the spacecraft flew over the area of the plume
new highresolut heat map of the south pole by cassini composit infrar spectromet show that the socal tiger stripe giant fissur that are the sourc of the geyser are warm along almost their entir length and reveal other warm fissur nearbi these more precis new measur reveal temperatur of at least minus __ degre celsius minus ___ fahrenheit that is __ degre celsius __ degre fahrenheit warmer than previous seen and __ degre celsius ___ degre fahrenheit warmer than other region of the moon the warmest region along the tiger stripe correspond to two of the jet locat seen in cassini imag
enceladus has got warmth water and organ chemic some of the essenti build block need for life we have quit a recip for life on our hand but we have yet to find the final ingredi liquid water but enceladus is onli whet our appetit for more said denni matson cassini project scientist at nasa jet/ENTITY propuls/ENTITY laboratori/ENTITY at closest approach cassini was onli __ mile from enceladus when it flew through the plume it was ___ mile from the moon surfac cassini next flybi of enceladus is in august
