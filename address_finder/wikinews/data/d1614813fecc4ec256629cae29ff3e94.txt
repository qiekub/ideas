what is the current situat in the nwfp
the pashtun peopl are or were renown for their hospit mani western comment on it some with suspicion not will to believ some peopl so poor could be so generous it was almost a charact flaw one could travel with out fear of person danger as long as you follow local protocol i would urg you to read kipl east is east west is west one more time know this time that it is written about the pashtun peopl
that was the sort of mind set among the peopl an ageless paradigm of self satisfact this is enshrin in the code of the pashtun way of life see jame spain the way of the pathan call pashtunwali in pashto hospit is refer to as maelmastiya
the islam radic is in realiti noth but the taliban movement as i said earlier not all pashtun are taliban obvious but most taliban are pashtun of these most belong to the of these most were affect by their cousin from afghanistan come over mingl with them were arabafghan uzbek and some tajik and even chechen some of these marri within the tribe and form a bond with the local marriag bond go back in histori again rememb the mindset of the peopl here alway keep that in mind to them the scriptur in the written word of god and that includ the old testament call torat torah and injeel bibl less st paul contribut
this taliban show itself in the content of the friday sermon at the mosqu now it show in the popular of grow beard especi sinc the the coalit of religi polit parti won power more recent in their showdown with the pakistan armi in n and s waziristan where accord to my sourc peopl prefer go to the taliban for justic rather than the older system of malik and polit agent the latter are known as corrupt in pakistan in general peopl are sick of the amount of corrupt
and now in from where hail the chief minist of the nwfp mr durrani is in taliban control in the sens that there is a parallel govern that they have establish and which is function quit well and is popular among the peopl
justic in tribal area of pakistan has been handl by elder follow a mixtur of tribal tradit and islam law would you say that taliban influenc has caus a stricter intrepret of islam law in the nwfp
yes the malik or tribal elder who consid themselv quit conserv religi even so had a laid back attitud toward enforc of religi doctrin that is where the differ come my opinion is that this is the reason that the malik support the govern of pakistan in south waziristan which has recent been in the news have kick out the milit uzbek who came as guest in the postsoviet era and start mischief of their own but am not sure what their agenda was to begin with and i myself have question about their presenc as to whi they were not report earlier sinc report the presenc of ani foreign in the fata is job one of the pakistani polit agent pa whi is the presenc of the uzbek and the chechen in the area just come to light rememb there are seven of these pas one for each fata the taliban emul the saudi system of have a depart concern with citizen moral even the name is the same the depart for the promot of virtu and prevent of vice and this depart has as in saudi arabia an enforc polic call mutawwain a moral lawenforc agenc
has there been a shift from tribal elder to cleric as the main interpret of law
yes there has been a movement in that direct but it has start a power struggl between the cleric who tradit have been at the lowest strata of the social structur to now when they have seen a bigger role for themselv first from the taliban in afghanistan but also the govern of the mma in the nwfp who are noth more than glorifi cleric themselv onli a littl smarter in exploit religion polit and the mma is larg nonpashtun which is a sourc of discont in that they stand in the way of pashtun nation such as it is becaus it onli rear it head when nonpashtun start to usurp power over what the pashtun consid their turf
the deal made between pakistani central govern and the north and south waziristan provinc where tribal leadership was given the pivot role in deal with milit and the taliban has been critic as a failur what caus an initi by tribal author to fail
first off i dont agre with the premis of the question that the deal is a failur for the follow reason
in the first place the pakistan armi govt same differ did not have mani option this was the least worst option they had
and most import i have said this befor this area is liter in a time warp which mean they proceed at what seem to us in the west a glacial pace i will give an exampl from the url stori goe that a pashtun had to repay badal an enemi for a crime against his famili and he wait patient for __ year some say __ year after this time he exact his reveng but soon after was depress becaus he wonder did i act too hastilyso one part of pashtunwali is to pay back badal liter to exchang which most peopl translat as reveng yes that is the form that is most visibl but badal is also play out in the exchang of gift at wed and other celebr and in the exchang of favor like in polit the rule can be arcan unwritten and hard to follow who did what to whom when and so on and what is the proper recompens this same give and take would occur in a peac process pursu by the tribal malik who rule by consensus see olaf caro and there is no actual leader in the western sens becaus all the malik in fact all the other are de facto so mani coequal the way of the pathan peopl of the khyber jame spain pp ___ on it is a mind set a paradigm foreign to the uniniti as is the concept of consensu gay sex to the wazir in waziristan
i wish someon would read the histori of this area it would help in deal with our expect and possibl much more for instanc there are two major tribe in n and s waziristan the wazir and the mahsud in the news you hear about the sub tribe the most famour charact of north waziristan the equival of a jess jame was leader call the faqir of ippi he die in ____ the pakistan govt never was abl to captur him even though he set up a govt of independ pashtunistan in cahoot with kabul the great upris of india of ____ had it root in waziristan as did the treati of razmak of all the pashtun the wazir are the most independ mind and the least to be cow by militari action
so what option did pakistan have more militari action it had alreadi lost hundr of their privat in action allow the us forc to come in as a matter of fact the isaf do cross into the pakistani territori we just dont know how deep they go the rule of engag as i understand them are that if they the us armi of marin are in hot pursuit then they cross into pakistan in realiti they do it more often then that just that there is no proof of it who will report it the wazir or the pakistan armi
the last part of your question there are mani assumpt all wrong the initi was not from the tribal there is no singl author amongst the tribal they would conven a jirga and decid on a cours of action such as this to my knowledg no such jirga was call to save face the pakistan govern might claim it was a tribal initi but it seem high unlik the pak troop casualti were so high and there was talk of hostag be held as well i tend to believ that the governor of the nwfp initi the talk and the agreement becaus he sure as hell is take all the heat for it failur
that bring me to the last issu the agreement has not fail becaus it has not been given enough time in wazir time refer not american time presidenti elect cycl control i do not have a crystal ball but if i did i would see nato troop in afghanistan long after iraq is over afghanistan can be a success onli if we accept one thing the time warp these peopl live in by my reckon it still ____ ce over there
if the taliban of pakistan is part due to a percept of corrupt among the older system of malik and polit agent and musharraf has critic line up who can the us turn to in dispens with __ billion in aid moni
taliban has noth to do with your premis there zilch nada the corrupt is in the the pak armi and the pak system of polit agent pa assign to these tribal zone pata these pa have budget that are much like the in that they are a singl line item in the nation budget there is no account of where or how the pa spend the money if one follow the ir rule and look at the lifestyl of the pa and compar them with their incom you would soon understand what was go on musharraf critic are a larger issu for eon republican have coddl pakistan with the belief that as long as they are pro america democraci in pakistan will come in due cours democrat have i think insist democraci first and then we can discuss the other issu later for exampl pre ___ compar how carter administr treat gen zia and how reagan administr treat him
the taliban of pakistan has more to do with graduat of a place near lahor where the tablighi jamaat conduct brainwash camp it was graduat of this place in my opinion that are respons for britain __/ENTITY attack/ENTITY as an exampl for the taliban of the fata see ahm/ENTITY rashid/ENTITY classic studi on the subject wrt to afghanistan but applic to pashtun in the nwfp equal in a sens
corrupt amongst the malik is self limit becaus of the egalitarian societi they live becaus of pashtunwali see charl lindholm oxford press
who can the us turn to this is a tough one the pakistani nation psych has not progress the way the indian have there are still veri much remnant of the raj visibl and present and invis but pakistani behavior give it away in the way they treat household help in the way compani boss treat their employe in the way the govern offic often act abov the law for exampl the nwfp is suppos to be dri yet the governemt employe consum copious amount of liquor there are some that even moonshin at home i have pictur i could share taken at danc parti more like a stag parti
i think this last question is best answer in who has been reliabl in the past and assum the past to be an indic of futur behavior
we know the pak armi will siphon larg amount toward it nuclear program and the upkeep of it general
we know that nawaz sharif left the nation treasuri almost bankrupt when musharraf took over
we know that benazir husband took __ of all govern deal i believ he has an interpol warrant for his arrest although i cant vouch for it it doe come out in the news even though it puzzl whi interpol has troubl execut the warrant now i hear they are withdrawn
so who doe that leav
the next generat of politician who are not beholden to anyon
in my opinion the us should insist on the schedul elect but acced to some genuin pakistani concern
nawaz sharif and benazir bhutto ought to be inelig to run but other member of the respect parti pml n and ppp b can do so
prohibit alloc of emblem to the religi parti which they can have misus
for exampl in the last elect they ask for and got the symbol of a book they then went on to advertis the symbol repres the quran and a vote for the book was a vote for the quran not the candid but the quran well the ploy work onli too well imagin a similar vote here where a vote is ask for as a vote for the bibl you can imagin the result
what is your take on the musharraf suspend the judg iftikhar chaudhri my take
i believ and this is wide held belief that musharraf has no constitu of his own for his power base he want legitim from the suprem court and from mr choudhri as chief justic their system is not like our would not give it
so musharraf has had to hang on to his armi chief of staff posit to get his power from the armi if some one els were chief of staff that person could refus to support musharraf
the justic favor to the general is justic iqbal who was not the next in line for chief justic the next in line is a hindu that present problem of it own for musharraf so when the hindu judg went for a trip to india iqbal becam the avail senior most suprem court judg and henc the hast and lack of decorum with which justic chaudhri was remov
now we have to wait for the other shoe to fall will iqbal issu a judici rule which would make it easi for musharraf to stay on as chief of staff in the meantim the us has ask him to relinquish this armi posit
needless to say it was veri bad handl high hand and the tv was present the countri saw what was be done to the highest member of the court of law and in their mind as in mine the law in pakistan was be manhandl handcuf and sent off pack to jail so to speak someth we long suspect but was confirm on tv and in the newspap oversea organ take up chaudhri caus might lead one to beliv that musharraf day are number and they would be wrong becaus america need musharraf for the time be anyway becaus iraq has scare america just as in the post vietnam era there is now a fear regard muslim countri the fear of the altern will democraci in muslim countri give us more of ahmedinejad or almaliki or can we find some hamid karzai we just dont know
can you tell us what the prevail sentiment in the region regard the pakistani govern effort in the provinc and the intern effort in afghanistan to combat taliban and affili milit
in my deal and inquir one thing stood out like a sore thumb the conspiraci theori visàvi anyth have to do with america i mention to one of my close friend that event that were previous ascrib as act of god were now consid act of the some even believ that the earthquak in the northern area was becaus of some sort of underground secret bomb use by the cia lack of evid is further proof that the cia did it i was flabbergast and start to give this kind of think as an exampl in speak to educ pakistani and among these those that did agre that the earthquak was not the work of the cia they would start give other exampl notabl the blow up of the plane carri zia ul haq an ex presid of pakistan in which the us ambassador also perish when i would point this out the respons would be that that is the sort of thing they do to take away suspicion from themselv
in a nutshel the impress i came away with is there is no war of civil go on what is go on is a war between literaci and illiteraci i use the latter term in the widest connot
pakistan govern effort while on the one hand peopl would decri that the govern is not do enough in the same breath they would state the govern is a puppet of the us and onli doe what the us tell it to do in this sens there is veri littl awar among the peopl about what the pakistani armi is do in the fata or for that matter in the local newspap are censor and if not censor they do not alloc much space to the topic dawn which is the highest circul english languag paper carri more stori about the us than about the local stori that might appear say in newsweek
the intern effort in afghanistan is not consid intern at all onli american you could speak till you are blue in the face and you would not chang anyon mind in my case they would simpli turn quiet not wish to offend a guest see pashtunwali
it is common agre that some thing has to be done to curb the religi extrem that has taken root here while histor these peopl pashtun are a moder peopl see olaf caro the pathan in fact some of the reason the extrem has crept in is that mani of the cultur practic were not in accord with saudi base salafi more popular known as wahab but mr wahab date to the period of lawrenc of arabia salaf date further back and is one of the six or seven school of fiqh or jurisprud but the latter fiqh has morph into a cult like sect
taliban are not visibl in the area i visit but the milit handiwork clear is as elsewher the common crimin are take advantag of this situat and crime is up signific one new crime is cell phone snatch it easi and nobodi want to pursu it if some one is use a razr phone he can expect to be hit soon if he use it in public so peopl have two cell phone call mobil here one fanci to show off one for use in public place
in so far as foreign milit are captur and identifi that is to say nonpashtun includ non afghan pashtun or pak pashtun then the peopl are obvious in agreement with the govern that these peopl dont belong here and need to go
the problem is this
the foreign are usual in the fata and have been there sinc the soviet war time mani of them have taken local wive and now have a famili the local have accept them into their famili now for the pak govt to ask them to kick them out the local are think what am i do to my grandchildren father etc again the edict of pashtunwali also play a role
what kind of support is there in the area for the posit advoc by the taliban on matter such as sharia law women educ role in public affair it proscript on entertain such as movi music etc
in the area that i visit and the peopl that i spoke to which by definit is a veri nonrandom sampl the peopl are total oppos to the taliban i do have one nephew who seem to have come under the influenc of the salafi but that is a differ stori i can address that separ and you can decid if it belong with this stori not my nephew stori but the way the salafi have woven themselv into this area which is histor a hanafi fiqh area which is much more moder like i said this may be tangenti to the main stori
in general peopl will say yes we are muslim and we are for the sharia but in general most peopl do not know what that entail
in their mind it entail a more just system a less corrupt govern
but if you ask them if they want a system like the taliban the answer is an unequivoc no
women educ is quit the norm in the non fata part of the nwfp when i visit the earthquak area which is also most in the nwfp i have photo and video the girl school were some of the first to spring up i rememb be pleasant surpris by this at the time
as far as a role in public it get complic women are in general expect to be docil and compliant and the same expect foloow through into public affair but this point of view is not limit to the nwfp it is the same all over pakistan exclud the larg citi of lahor karachi islamabad etc yet still applic to peshawar
in peshawar you do get to see more girl get job as teller in a bank and some other non tradit job wherea previous the onli job were either teacher to young kid teacher to older girl nurs and doctor for the most part
movi in the nwfp in the theater are for the lower socio econom men onli the reason is other than taliban the easi avail of pirat good qualiti dvds of indian and hollywood movi from china thru the land rout over the karakorum highway it cost rs___ _ for the whole famili to watch a movi in the comfort of their home travel to a theater might cost that much in gas the inconvi the crowd the men gawk at the women and last but definit not least some bomb explod in the theater some year back put a comllet stop to the middl class from go out to see movi
paashtun love music so even though i hear that some bus driver have been fine for play their cassett i doubt this is go to stop them from play their music some thing far wors has to happen i think the driver may start carri gun and have it out with who ever is tring to stop them from their favorit music
what is not be report and what the taliban could do effect is to cut up cabl tv cabl most cabl compani string their cabl abov ground to save cost and take it along the electr pole below the electr wire sinc these are expos there have been mani sever instanc of the cabl be cut up luckiliy there is no market for coaxial cabl or more cabl would be lost to druggi do the cut the latter is a serious problem that you dont hear about one person that i knew told me that he was build his hous and had pour conret and reinforc for the pillar the next day he found the reinforc bar to have been cut up flush with the ground slab leav him to figur out how to do the rebar of the rest of the pillar
to what degre doe this support stem from fear and intimid
the taliban are pashtun and the populac is pashtun the pashtun do not scare easi they are not intimid easili they might compli for the moment and then come back with a vengeanc so to speak the women folk are more suscept to intimid as was evidenc by the closur of the school becaus the mother decid that they were not go to take a chanc that their kid might get injur
how about the polit posit of the insurg movement resist to foreign troop and the govern is there a separatist or nationalist compon to the movement
karzai is not popular among the pashtun who are loyal to pakistan in the nwfp those are the one i met most they think that karzai is opportunist in that he is fleec the govern of the us wherea he himself is littl more than the mayor of kabul they point to his american bodyguard as proof that he is dislik by his own peopl that the moment the american leav karzai is a dead man
i can not speak to the separatist movement i have seen no evid of it there is widespread resent that the feder govern refus to give a name to the provinc a name of the peopl like there have been recent articl in dawn about this i will tri and find them for you
nation is aliv and well on the other hand all over pakistan in all it four provinc everybodi hate the punjabi almost to the man
it is my opinion that were it not for us aid pakistan will go the rout of yugoslavia with lot of bloodsh
resist to foreign troop is like the nation pastim among the pashtun even today they collect in the even and will tell tale vast glorifi of the way their grandfath fought against the british
in other part of the nwfp like charsadda and mardan where abdul ghaffar khan the frontier gandhi was popular you have old khudai khidmatgar tell their stori of how they kick out the british
the onli thing that unit the pashtun are foreign troop on their soil other than that pashtun uniti is almost an oxymoron
what do you think the us the intern communiti and pakistan should do to eas the problem in the region
in my opinion base on my convers with individu in posit to know these thing plus a littl bit of plain common sens plus know the histori of the peopl and of the area the one thing that will not work is direct militari action we know this from histori we know that the pashtun love to fight we know that the taliban has brought the jihadi into the pictur who like noth better than to be martyr so we need to keep this in mind of what not to do have said that what i am go to say next may appear like a paradox
becaus the pashtun do not like to deal with what they believ are wus or weak peopl we do need to have a strong presenc there and a strong show of forc invit a jirga to like a demonstr of what the us air forc is capabl of do just to show them the reason is that their paradigm is the __th centuri if you simpli told them that we can do this to you they will simpli think you are lie becaus that is what they do they lie to show off
but if you drop a daisi cutter and tell them befor hand what it is capabl of or a stealth bomber these technolog are outsid their mindset we have to get them to believ that we have these capabl like the drone or spi satellit
from this posit of strength and alway remind them that we are rare to use our forc in that like them we also love to shoot our gun at everi opportun but then not actual do it in this sens we had achiev all out object with saddam prior to invad iraq imho invad iraq was redund so the next step would be
develop mean provid a mean of livelihood so they do not have to becom militari mercenari to make a live
gradual replac their madrassa with our own madrassa except in the latter the mullah is an educ individu who know compar religion and they teach other subject includ biolog anthropolog measur the age of the earth by carbon date etc and astronomi to learn the age of the univers black hole quasar relat concept quantum mechan concept not the mathemat the simpl concept behind them and how these idea are behind some of today everyday electron devic
leisur activ start with tradit leisur activ ie not tv and cabl and internet but ultim make these avail
introduc these new technolog through a religi mode transmit a quran recit competit to begin with as an exampl instead of begin with mtv
make water avail drink water is an everyday necess for cook etc and not avail in most of the fata
food grain wheat flour etc keep the price the same as in peshawar these peopl are not trader they are easili exploit and like porn they couldnt tell you what exploit is but they can tell you when they see it
what make the northwest frontier provinc compet to administ ani moni
this is the central question much like california has taken a separ initi on stem cell research as an analog the nwfp is central to the war on terror not pakistan
the nwfp was central to the fight and aid to the afghan dure the soviet occup not pakistan
this small distinct is lost on washington and it is the main reason in my opinion whi so much of the aid was lost in transit was becaus the punjabi armi offic could not bring themselv to dispens such larg sum to an ethnic group which it consid antipakistani you would have to read the histori of the indian partit in particular that the nwfp was a indian congress parti control provinc where as the muslim leagu of jinnah was tri to show the brit that all the area was for the creation of pakistan
all the fata is contigu to the nwfp the taliban and alqaeda are hole up somewher either in the fata or across the durand line in afghanistan the durand line has never been recogn by the local as an intern boundari even today the pashtun travel from peshawar to kabul by road with out a passport or visa and it has been like that for eon
especi for the nomad pashtun tribe of ghilzai who travel by caravan and conduct trade
the present governor of the nwfp belong to the orakzai tribe he spell his name aorakzai and it is my opinion that that he was pick part becaus he belong to one of the fata as well as he is a retir general of the pak armi
the frontier constabulari fc is a forc which primarili recruit from the fata all or most of it forc are from the various tribe in the eye of the tribe this is a bona fide forc and servic with the fc is consid an honor thing the us has alreadi alloc some fund for increas recruit but far less than what it would take to counter the taliban and far less than what the econom need is the us spend a thousand time more on a battalion sent to monitor activ over there plus whi endang the live of our troop and spread our forc thin when a more effect job can be done by the fc the fc has over histori shown that they will attack and use forc against the tribe that creat troubl there have been no instanc of insubordin or mutini
even the us embassi is protect by a conting of the fc that goe to show their trustworthi disciplin
my second propos is that there is a common phenomenon for pashtun men to go to the gulf state for job
the tribal pashtun all pashtun are tribal in that pashtun form the largest tribal societi in the world in term of number wrt the fata are not educ or train and henc not employ right now i propos that we fund direct the director of emigr mr azhar arbab in islamabad to set up train facil in concret lay iron work pipe work weld etc which would then qualifi these tribesmen to obtain job in the gulf as such we would remov them from the scene altogeth they would not be avail in the labor pool to the taliban or anyon els i might add here that a number of these individu have veri high innat intellig which is one reason they make formid foe
now the central reason whi the nwfp ought to do this is becaus they are themselv most affect by the scourg of taliban they are high motiv in carri out these polici becaus it is to their own benefit
one has to be convinc on this last point and for that i urg you research the sentiment amongst the peopl of the provinc such as i am will to provid and which you can corrobor from other sourc as well
for instanc after malik saad was murder there were peopl whom i heard myself that express the feel admit stun with grief if this is islam then fuck such islam i paraphras obvious the pashto is not direct translat moreov mr saad poster are compet with osama in the bazaar as a spontan gestur from the public we cant afford to let this goodwil to be lost
an associ press report on msnbc date march __ ____ and headlin arrest of alqaida best reflect chang role state a senior western diplomat in islamabad who request anonym becaus of the sensit of the issu said the taliban resurg had not necessarili led to the reemerg of alqaida train camp in pakistan a key us alli in the war on terror but had creat the environ for whatev is left of alqaida to feel more comfort what doe that mean
a senior western diplomat usual mean a polit offic in the us embassi which most peopl know is a cia agent or it could be some other embassi offici
first there is a big differ between al qaeda and the taliban
al qaeda is most compos of arab they do not trust ani one els while they might use other as courier or in lowli posit as servant for second rate al qaeda offici the top guy onli deal with arab and are serv by arab
the taliban are most pashtun tribesmen most they are graduat of madrassa
most illiter by ani world standard the better educ among them will know how to speak a few word of english such as their inform minist there might be one or two notabl except of which i am not awar i had heard yale had admit a taliban but never follow up on the stori
howev while al qaeda doe not trust the taliban the taliban look up to al qaeda top leadership we saw this situat in iraq where initi al zarqawi had no direct link with qaeda but was keen to form one it would be conjectur on my part to state that in the end he did inde succeed in form that connect in the press at least that impress was preval
so the line of interest proceed one way like one way traffic extremist want to be affili with qaeda imho while the latter doe not again in my opinion want to so as to maintain it hideout
now we come to the statement below
the taliban resurg is not connect direct to the qaeda
al in arab the qaeda mean the base or the foundat eg in kg school here you are ask did you learn your abc in the muslim world one is ask in an equival kg did you learn your qaeda
the qaeda suppli line are hamper new recruit would have to be arab and they would have to travel a long way through tight pakistani secur to reach here or suffer hardship over a long and arduous land rout through balochistan and the tribal area not all of which are accommod
so as is becom clear qaeda is have troubl replac peopl they loos mean those that were captur or die they onli trust arab and that also a certain type of arab not all arab are the same not all arab is the same for exampl they would never trust a syrian in fact qaeda folk consid syrian brand of islam an apostasi but that is anoth stori
okay so now we can understand the statement that whatev remain of the qaeda are not in a posit to set up train camp sinc they are in a surviv mode the taliban resurg help them get a littl warm and fuzzi in this surviv mode sinc they feel a littl bit more secur with their partnersinarm do some evil stuff blow up peopl and caus mayhem
how mani men doe the fc field current
the fc current has about _____ men in total
how much do they get paid
they are paid the equival of __ per month per person pak rupe ____ where rs__ _
they do have some fring benefit but life is veri spartan for these soldier
what the us could get in return is a huge bang for a buck no pun intend
i think we ought to doubl the number of these soldier with one proviso that the fc maintain it high standard of recruit
compar this with our cost in the war against terror just halliburton bill will have you reel i think that it would be foolish not to do this
again to reinforc the reason
the frontier constabulari is an institut with a long and glorious histori within the frontier provinc
the recruit come strict from the tribe of the various fata and so they are veri familiar with the peopl the bad guy the terrain etc
they speak the pashto dialect of the local the pashto languag has mani dialect and you can tell where someon is from base on which dialect he speak so if you do not speak the correct dialect you are immedi identifi as an outsid this is one reason whi these tribe are imposs to penetr there are other reason as well that are beyond the scope of the current discuss
how can the fc help prevent attack like the suicid bomb attempt on in charsadda last weekend
in essenc your question is how can anyon prevent a suicid attack
and frank if i knew the answer to that i think the us militari and sever other group would be knock on my door i think the isra armi has had the most experi with this sort of thing the suicid bomb as a tactic weapon was invent by the tamil tiger in sri lanka and even today in term of statist they use it in far greater number
so to summar neither the fc nor anyon els can prevent a suicid bomb we could attempt to improv our intellig to find out about an immin attack but so far these have not been veri success in pakistan
in the lal masjid case the govern avoid a suicid kill by negoti with those two mullah brother but i dont know if that count but it doe make for an interest stori both washington dc and islamabad now have madam threaten to publish the list of their client unless they are given protect who would have thunk
go back to your question
in my opinion what ought to be done is to make a polici chang and address the issu that are produc these suicid bomber that is the onli way to stop this phenomenon
in this part of the world this is relat new becaus prior to ___ suicid bomb was unheard of moreov it is not the fcs job to provid secur to the minist of the interior that is the job of the polic forc becaus this ministri is equival to the depart of homeland secur
you dont expect border patrol to provid bodi guard duti to the secretari of the depart of homeland secur
i am make these analog so the american reader would relat to what is happen and understand the differ in nomenclatur ____ _ may ____ utc
