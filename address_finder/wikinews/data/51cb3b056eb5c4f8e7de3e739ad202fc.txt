as you campaign around your ride it like that some issu are mention more often by voter than other issu what would you say are the three hottest topic this elect in your ride what would you and your parti do to address these issu
in haldimandnorfolk the three hottest topic in this elect are the impass over land claim in caledonia the state of agricultur and food polici and health care
land claim

agricultur and food polici
we need a food polici that put canadian farmer first i will fight for a nation food strategi that priorit canadian farm by promot local agricultur food safeti and food secur canadian should be encourag to buy local food stuff howev we have to ensur they are protect from foodborn ill the govern must do more to support farmer and to keep our food suppli safe
i believ in the wheat board and support suppli manag farm program should be simplifi and made transpar the conserv govern has margin the farm communiti it claim to repres we need concret support for our farmer and a real solut for tobacco produc not more polit and postur
health care
famili in haldimandnorfolk deserv qualiti health care as a medic doctor i understand the challeng face our communiti includ a lack of physician long wait time and spiral drug cost the size of your bank account should not be the determin of the qualiti of care you receiv we will continu to fight to ensur that the futur of health care doe not follow this cours our health care system should remain publiclyfund and proper fund
all patient have a fundament right to receiv access to time care for necessari medic servic it is unaccept that too mani canadian are without a famili physician wait time in emerg room or for import diagnos are too long becaus there arent enough nurs or other medic profession to keep up with the increas need with an age popul we need a plan to ensur greater access to health care profession i will work hard to attract new doctor and bring better health servic to our communiti i will support the liber doctor and nurs fund which will invest ___ million to ensur all canadian have access to a medic profession i will also work to ensur that the goal of the nation pharmaceut strategi are achiev name catastroph drug coverag
are there ani misconcept about you your leader or your parti and platform
i think there are sever misconcept about stéphane dion he is a strong thought leader who is genuin in his desir to serv the best interest of canadian throughout the liber leadership campaign his integr was never question
this is a man who stood up to lucien bouchard dure the height of the separatist debat in quebec he took critic becaus of his stanc in his home provinc yet he continu to fight for nation uniti this strong vision of canada remain evid today his innov idea promis to deliv prosper to canadian
the green shift plan is poor understood this marriag of the economi to the environ is an innov step that will provid canada with the opportun to reinvigor the economi and resum it place as a global leader in fight climat chang effect
the green shift is design to tax less the thing we want more of like incom invest and job and tax more the thing we want less of like pollut and greenhous gas emiss it is revenu neutral the auditor general will certifi that everi dollar collect from the carbon tax will be return to canadian i support the green shift and i support stéphane dion
