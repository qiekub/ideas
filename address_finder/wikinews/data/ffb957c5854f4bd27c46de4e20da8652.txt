which of you competitor do you expect to pose the biggest challeng to your candidaci whi what make you the most desir candid run in the ride
as a green parti candid i recogn that all the major parti pose a big challeng they all have establish ride constitu and financi support far beyond anyth we can realist expect in this elect howev the green parti repres the grass root and will be better abl to put forward the issu of growth in harmoni with the environ and protect of the lake simco watersh they are both issu veri import to the ride
what do you feel are the three most import issu to voter in your ride are these the same top three issu most import to you what would you do to address these issu
bad develop the extens build of singl famili dwell with no centr of shop amen
no job growth in the develop or nearbi peopl have to commut caus more smog congest and air pollut
degrad of the lake simco watersh this degrad is take place as a result of poor water manag smelter byproduct dump and the pave over of larg area of the oak ridg morain
these are also issu about which i have great concern we must stop all develop on the lake simco watersh until a comprehens studi can be complet to identifi where develop can take place with minim impact on the watersh this will have to be done through legisl like the propos lake simco act
smart plan techniqu should be adopt where the develop are along exist corridor of infrastructur they should includ mix densiti hous afford hous senior hous shop and cafe facil for doctor lawyer dentist etc all with walk or bike distanc this type of plan promot a communiti spirit peopl meet and talk and know each other there tend to be less crime this approach to plan is in use all over the world
develop should also be requir to build facil to encourag busi to locat nearbi peopl can travel short distanc to work
what should be the first order of busi for the __th legisl assembl
climat chang is a fact and we see it in mani of the everyday event eg this summer we have had the same amount of rainfal as usual but it fell in sever veri heavi shower as oppos to the longer more ground penetr kind we usual have consid this i think the first order of busi should be to look at the mani small chang that can consider reduc our carbon footprint the technolog is avail other countri and citi are use it let act now and get that leadership from the govern of ontario
are properti tax in your ride at a fair level for the amount of servic receiv in the municip
the whole issu of properti tax need to be revisit the green parti propos to place a moratorium on ani increas in the assess market valu of all residenti properti and to establish a royal commiss to studi altern such as a locat valu tax system also consid a system which doe not penal properti owner for make improv
how can the provinc lead the way in stimul job creation
we need to becom the leader in green job in sustain industri recent trend show that the public is will to pay more for greener product small busi and coop are import engin of a vibrant green economi and should be encourag and money should be divert to the form of loan to help them get start
what are your view on the mix/ENTITY member/ENTITY proport/ENTITY represent/ENTITY mmp referendum
i am in support of chang the elector system to mmp it will give the peopl of the provinc a greater influenc on the legislatur each person can now vote for the candid whom they feel best repres their ride irrespect of parti and then parti of their choic mani peopl have comment on the extra number of seat howev look at the mathemat this was the smallest number that could be use to allow a seat for a parti that get over _ of the vote also peopl now will have two repres to advoc for them in the legislatur
what role if ani doe new media play in your campaign and the campaign of your parti
both the green parti and i are make a lot of use of comput technolog and the internet the gpo web site is extens and kept well up to date and my own site url reevesca also has a lot of inform link and the opportun to donat on line to my campaign email and electron storag of inform great reduc the amount of paper be use and enabl us to communic effici with mani peopl across our veri larg ride
of the decis made by ontario __th legisl assembl which was the most benefici to your elector district to the provinc as a whole which was least benefici or even harm to your ride to the provinc as a whole
most benefici to our ride were the establish of the oak ridg morain protect and the announc of the green belt howev the bad decis was remov the teeth from the protect and allow the continu build on the lake simco watersh also exclud the west half of the ride between bradford and barri from the green belt again this will lead to further degrad of the watersh the decis to rais the mpp salari was a bad decis for the provinc as a whole especi in view of the lack of action on mani social issu
