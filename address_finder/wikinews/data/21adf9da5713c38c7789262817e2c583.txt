sunday januari _ ____ not just for smoke tobacco oil also make for an effici sourc of biofuel
a team of research from the thoma/ENTITY jefferson/ENTITY univers/ENTITY s biotechnolog foundat laboratori bfl in the unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY have manag to increas the amount of oil produc by tobacco leav tobacco oil can be veri effici convert to biofuel but most oil is locat in the seed which the plant doe not produc mani of
tobacco seed produc around __ oil per dri weight but a crop of the plant yield onli around ___kg of seed per acr the leav have an oil content of around ___ oil per dri weight the oil has previous been test for power dieselfuel vehicl and can be more effici convert than the product of mani other crop plant
the team from bfl identifi that oil product in the leav was control by two gene the diacyglycerol acytransferas dgat and the leafi cotyledon _ lec_ gene by genet engin they achiev oil yield of __ oil per dri weight by modifi the dgat while chang to the lec_ result in a yield of __ per dri weight
tobacco is veri attract as a biofuel becaus the idea is to use plant that arent use in food product said cancer biolog assist professor at thoma jefferson dr vyacheslav andrianov phd in some instanc the modifi plant produc __fold more oil in the leav
various effort are be made to find biofuel sourc that are not also potenti food in order to steer clear of caus further rise in global food cost last month the us govern anounc fund for research that use nonphotosynthesis microorgan to manufactur biodiesel in the hope that this will prove more effici than option that reli on this also escap one critic of biofuel like tobacco that competit for land to grow crop on will result in biofuel crop displac foodstuff and push food price up in novemb ____ a team launch a studi to determin if tobacco as well as the prick pear was capabl of withstand the harsh condit of land not suitabl for grow food select these plant for their abil to surviv water shortag
