wednesday march __ ____ artist concept of the planet and it parent star imag from common hubbl/ENTITY space/ENTITY telescop/ENTITY has detect in the atmospher of a planet __ away mark the first discoveri of an organ/ENTITY compound/ENTITY on a planet outsid our solar/ENTITY system/ENTITY the methan was found on a size planet name hd/ENTITY ______b/ENTITY the planet close orbit hd/ENTITY ______/ENTITY yellow/ENTITY dwarf/ENTITY star in the constel although methan can play a key role in the chemic reaction need to form life the planet is too close to it parent star to support life scientist say it is known as a hot/ENTITY jupit/ENTITY a planet whose mass is compar to that of jupit but orbit nearer to the parent star than our solar system innermost planet
this particular hot jupit take just two day to complet orbit it parent star and the temperatur in it atmospher can reach ____ degre fahrenheit around the melt point of this observ is proof that spectroscopi can eventu be done on a cooler and potenti habit earthsiz planet orbit a dimmer red dwarftyp star mark swain
the methan here although we can call it an organ constitu is not produc by life it is way too hot there for life said giovanna tinetti part of the nasa team that made the discoveri
howev scientist believ the method use to detect the methan can be use to find organ compound on other distant planet this observ is proof that spectroscopi can eventu be done on a cooler and potenti habit earthsiz planet orbit a dimmer red dwarftyp star said mark swain a nasa scientist whose paper on the discoveri will appear in the scientif journal spectroscopi is the split of light into it compon as the light from the star pass through the planet atmospher the atmospher gase imprint their chemic signatur onto the light allow the atmospher chemic composit to be analyz by near/ENTITY infrar/ENTITY camera/ENTITY and/ENTITY multiobject/ENTITY spectromet/ENTITY to their surpris astronom found much higher level of methan than had been predict for hot jupit this indic we dont realli understand exoplanet atmospher yet said swain
this discoveri also confirm the presenc of water molecul in the planet atmospher which was found by nasa spitzer/ENTITY space/ENTITY telescop/ENTITY last year use spectroscopi with this observ there is no question whether there is water or not water is present swain said
the ultim goal of these studi is to identifi the molecul of more like planet in the habit/ENTITY zone/ENTITY of star where condit may be favor for life
adam showman at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY arizona/ENTITY said we are thus now see but the open salvo in a revolut that will extend humankind view of planetari world far beyond the provinci boundari of our solar system
giovanna tinetti who coauthor the natur articl believ the concept of life on other planet is not too unlik my person view is it is way too arrog to think that we are the onli one live in the univers she say nasa say water found on exoplanet juli __ ____
