monday decemb __ ____
on decemb _ bbc/ENTITY news/ENTITY report a stori about dr jame/ENTITY anderson/ENTITY a teacher in the comput scienc depart at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY read/ENTITY in the unit/ENTITY kingdom/ENTITY in the report it was state that anderson had solv a veri import problem that was ____ year old the problem of divis/ENTITY by/ENTITY zero/ENTITY accord to the bbc anderson had creat a new number that he had name nulliti that lay outsid of the real/ENTITY number/ENTITY line/ENTITY anderson term this number a transreal number and denot it with the greek/ENTITY letter/ENTITY he had taught this number to pupil at highdown school in emmer/ENTITY green/ENTITY the bbc report provok mani reaction from mathematician and other
in reaction to the stori mark c chucarrol a comput scientist and research post a web/ENTITY log/ENTITY entri describ anderson as an idiot math teacher and describ the bbcs stori as absolut infuri and a stori that doe an excel job of demonstr what total innumer idiot report are chucarrol state that there was in fact no actual problem to be solv in the first place there is no number that meaning express the concept of what it mean to divid by zero he wrote state that all that anderson had done was assign a name to the concept of not a number someth which was not new in that the ieee/ENTITY floatingpoint/ENTITY standard/ENTITY which describ how comput repres floatingpoint number had includ a concept of not a number term sinc ____ chucarrol further continu
basic hes defin a nonsolut to a nonproblem and by teach it to his student hes do them a great disservic theyr go to leav his class believ that hes a great genius whos solv a suppos fundament problem of math and believ in this silli nulliti thing as a valid mathemat concept
it not like there isnt alreadi enough stuff in basic math for kid to learn there no excus for take advantag of a passiv audienc to shove this nonsens down their throat as an exercis in selfaggrandiz
to make matter wors this idiot is a comput scienc professor no one whos studi cs should be abl to get away with believ that reinvent the concept of nan is someth noteworthi or profound and no one whos studi cs should think that defin meaningless valu can somehow magic make invalid comput produc meaning result im asham for my field
there have been a wide rang of other reaction from other peopl to the bbc news stori comment rang from the humor and the iron such as the style observ that dividion by zero is imposs becaus my calcul say so and it is the truth and the chuck/ENTITY norri/ENTITY fact/ENTITY that onli chuck norri can divid by zero to which anoth reader repli chuck norri just look at zero and it divid itself through vigour defenc of dr anderson with sever peopl quot the lyric to ira/ENTITY gershwin/ENTITY s song they all laugh at christoph columbus to detail mathemat discuss of anderson propos axiom of transfinit number
the reput of the univers of read
sever reader have comment that they consid this to have damag the reput of the comput scienc depart and even the reput of the univers of read as a whole by publish his childish nonsens the bbc activ harm the reput of read univers wrote one reader look forward to see read univers math applic plummit wrote anoth ignor all research paper from the univers of read wrote a third im not sure whi you refer to read as a univers this is a place the bbc report as close down it physic depart becaus it too hard lectur at read should stick to folk danc and knit leav academ subject to grown up wrote a fourth steve kramarski lament that dr anderson is not from the univers of bbc journal
sever reader criticis the journalist at the bbc who ran the stori for not appar contact ani mathematician about dr anderson idea journalist are meant to check fact not just accept whatev they are told by a selfinterest third parti and publish it without question wrote one reader on the bbcs web site howev on anoth reader counter the report is from berkshir local news berkshir do you realli expect a local news team to have a math specialist find a newsworthi stori in berkshir probabl isnt that easi so local journalist have to cover ani piec of fluff that come up your attitud to the journalist should be sympathi not scorn ben/ENTITY goldacr/ENTITY author of the bad scienc column in the/ENTITY guardian/ENTITY wrote on his web log that what is odd is a report editor produc newsroom team cameraman soundman tv channel web editor web copi writer and so on all think it a good idea to cover a brilliant new scientif breakthrough whilst clear know noth about the context math isnt that hard you could even make a call to a mathematician about it continu that it all veri well for the bbc to think theyr be balanc and clever get dr anderson back in to answer queri about his theori on tuesday but that rather skip the issu and shine the spotlight quit unfair on him he look like a veri alright bloke to me
from read comment on his own web log as well as elsewher goldacr conclud that he thought that a lot of peopl might feel it report ben moor and the rest of his doubtless extens team the peopl who drove the stori who wed want to see answer the question from the mathematician
andrej bauer a profession mathematician from slovenia write on the bad scienc web log state that whoever report on this fail to call a univers professor to check whether it was realli new ani univers professor would have told this report that there are mani way of deal with divis by zero and that mr anderson was just one of known one
olli william one of the bbc radio berkshir report who wrote the bbc stori initi state that it seem odd to me that his theori would get as far as televis if it so easili blown out of the water by visitor to our site so there must be someth more to it and direct respond to critic of bbc journal on sever point on his web log
he point out that peopl should rememb that his target audienc was local peopl in berkshir with no mathemat knowledg and that he was not write for a global audienc of mathematician some peopl have had a go at dr anderson for use simplifi terminolog too he continu but he know were play to a mainstream audienc and at the time we film him he was show his theori to a class of schoolchildren those circumst were never go to breed an indepth halfhour scientif discuss and none of our regular reader would want that
on the matter of fact check he repli that if you onli want us to report scientif news onc it appear peerreview in a recognis journal it go to be veri dri and it probabl wont be news ad that it not for the bbc to becom a journal of mathemat that the job of journal of mathemat it for the bbc to provid live scienc report that engag and involv peopl and if you look at the origin page youll find a list as long as your arm of engag and involv peopl
william point out that we did not present dr anderson theori as gospel although with hindsight it could have been made clearer that this is veri much a theori and by no mean univers accept but we certain werent shout a mathemat revolut from the rooftop dr anderson has in one or two place been chastis for come to the media with his theori instead of his peer a sure sign of a quack boffin andor crank accord to one blogger actual one of our report happen to meet him dure a demonstr against the closur of the univers physic depart a coupl of week ago got chat and discov dr anderson reckon he was onto someth he certain didnt break the door down look for media coverag
mathemat analysi
some comment at the bbc web page and at have attempt serious mathemat descript of what anderson has done and subject it to analysi one descript was that anderson has taken the real/ENTITY number/ENTITY and given it complet so that all six of the common arithmet oper were surject/ENTITY function/ENTITY result in an object which is bare a commut/ENTITY ring/ENTITY with oper with ton of funki corner case and no actual gain in term of new theorem or strong relat statement from the extra axiom he has to tack on
jami sawyer a mathemat undergradu at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY warwick/ENTITY write in the warwick math societi discuss forum describ what anderson has done as decid that the socal extend/ENTITY real/ENTITY number/ENTITY line/ENTITY is not good enough becaus of the wonder issu of what is equal to and therefor creat a number system
andrej bauer state that anderson axiom of transreal arithmet are far from be origin first you can adjoin and to obtain someth call the extend/ENTITY real/ENTITY line/ENTITY then you can adjoin a bottom/ENTITY element/ENTITY to repres an undefin valu this is all standard and quit old in fact it is well known in domain/ENTITY theori/ENTITY which deal with how to repres thing we comput with that adjoin just bottom to the real is not a good idea it is better to adjoin mani socal partial element which denot approxim to real bottom is then just the trivial approxim which mean someth like ani real or undefin real
comment have point out that in the field of mathemat/ENTITY analysi/ENTITY which anderson has defin axiomat to be is the limit/ENTITY of/ENTITY sever/ENTITY function/ENTITY each of which tend to a differ valu at it limit
has two differ limit depend from whether approach zero from a posit or from a negat direct
also has two differ limit this is the argument that comment gave in fact has the valu for all and thus onli one limit it is simpli for howev that limit is differ to the two limit for support the comment main point that the valu of the various limit are all differ
whilst the limit can be shown to be _ by expand the function as an infinit taylor/ENTITY seri/ENTITY divid the seri by and then take the limit of the result which is _
whilst the limit can be shown to be _ by expand the function as an infinit taylor/ENTITY seri/ENTITY divid the seri subtract from _ by and then take the limit of the result which is _
comment have also note lhôpital/ENTITY rule/ENTITY it has been point out that anderson set of transreal number is not unlik the set of real number a mathemat simon/ENTITY tatham/ENTITY author of state that anderson system doesnt even think about the field axiom addit is no longer invert multipl isnt invert on nulliti or infin or zero but that expect so if your work in the transreal or transrat you cant do simpl algebra transform such as cancel and when both occur in the same express becaus that transform becom invalid if is nulliti or infin so even the simplest exercis of ordinari algebra spew off a constant stream of unless x is nulliti special case which you have to deal with separ in much the same way that the occasion divis spew off an unless x is zero special case onli much more often
tatham state that it tell that this monstros has been dream up by a comput scientist persist error indic and univers absorb state can often be good comput scienc but hes step way outsid his field of compet if he think that that also make them good math continu that anderson has also total miss the point when he tri to comput thing like use his arithmet the reason whi thing like that are general consid to be illdefin is not becaus of a lack of facil proof show them to have one valu or anoth it becaus of a surfeit of such proof all of which disagre ad anoth one doe not as he appear to believ solv ani problem at all in other word is what is known in mathemat analysi as an indetermin/ENTITY form/ENTITY not a not a number
to mani observ it appear that anderson has done noth more than reinvent the idea of a special valu that comput have been use in calcul to repres undefin result for over two decad in the various intern standard for comput includ the ieee/ENTITY floatingpoint/ENTITY standard/ENTITY and ibm standard for decim arithmet a divis of ani nonzero number by zero result in one of two special infin valu inf or inf the sign of the infin determin by the sign of the two operand negat/ENTITY zero/ENTITY exist in floatingpoint represent and a divis of zero by zero result in nan
anderson himself deni that he has reinvent nan and in fact claim that there are problem with nan that are not share by nulliti accord to anderson mathemat arithmet is sociolog invalid and ieee floatingpoint arithmet with nan is also faulti in one of his paper on a perspex machin deal with the axiom of transreal arithmet jami sawyer write that he has worri about someth which appear to be name after a plastic perspex be a trade name for polymethyl/ENTITY methacryl/ENTITY in the uk anderson write
we cannot accept an arithmet in which a number is not equal to itself nan nan or in which there are three kind of number plain number silent number and signal number becaus on write such a number down in daili discours we can not alway distinguish which kind of number it is and even if we adopt some notat convent to make the distinct clear we cannot know how the signal number are to be use in the absenc of have the whole program and comput that comput them avail so whilst ieee floatingpoint arithmet is an improv on real arithmet in so far as it is total not partial both arithmet are invalid model of arithmet
in fact the standard convent for distinguish the two type of nan when write them down can be seen in isoiec/ENTITY _____/ENTITY anoth intern standard for how comput deal with number which use qnan for nonsignal quiet nan and snan for signal nan anderson continu
nan semant are not defin except by a long list of special case in the ieee standard
in other word write scott lamb a bsc in comput scienc from the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY idaho/ENTITY they are defin but he doesnt like the definit
the main differ between nulliti and nan accord to both anderson and comment is that nulliti compar equal to nulliti wherea nan doe not compar equal to nan comment have point out that in veri short order this differ lead to contradictori result they state that it requir onli a few line of proof for exampl to demonstr that in anderson system of transreal arithmet both and after which in one comment word one can prove anyth that you like in aim to provid a complet system of arithmet by ad extra axiom defin the result of the divis of zero by zero and of the consequ oper on that result half as mani again as the number of axiom of realnumb arithmet anderson has produc a selfcontradictori system of arithmet in accord with gödel/ENTITY incomplet/ENTITY theorem/ENTITY step _ profit
one readersubmit comment append to the bbc news articl read step _ creat solut _ creat problem _ profit an allus to the busi plan employ by the underp/ENTITY gnome/ENTITY of the comedi televis seri south/ENTITY park/ENTITY in fact anderson doe plan to profit from nulliti have regist on the __th of juli ____ a privat limit compani name transreal comput ltd whose mission statement is to develop hardwar and softwar to bring you fast and safe comput that doe not fail on divis by zero and to promot educ and train in transreal comput the compani is current in the research and develop phase prior to trade in hardwar and softwar
in a present given to potenti investor in his compani at the angl plc showcas on the __th of novemb ____ held at the univers of read anderson state his aim for the compani as be
to build a transreal comput
to deriv maxwel/ENTITY equat/ENTITY classic/ENTITY gravit/ENTITY in transreal number so that they have no nake singular infin affect a neighbourhood of space
to collabor with anyon who want to unifi quantum/ENTITY electrodynam/ENTITY with gravit
to investor anderson make the follow promis
i will help you develop a curriculum for transreal arithmet if you want me to
i will help you unifi qed and gravit if you want me to
i will build a transreal supercomput
he ask potenti investor
how much would you pay to know that the engin in your ship car aeroplan or heart pacemak wont just stop dead
how much would you pay to know that your govern comput control militari hardwar wont just stop or misfir
the current model of comput arithmet are in fact alreadi design to allow programm to write program that will continu in the event of a divis by zero the ieee frequent ask question document for the floatingpoint standard give this repli to the question whi doesnt divis by zero or overflow or underflow stop the program or trigger an error
the ieee ___ model encourag robust program it is intend not onli for numer analyst but also for spreadsheet user databas system or even coffe pot the propag rule for nan and infin allow inconsequenti except to vanish similar gradual underflow maintain error properti over a precis rang
when except situat need attent they can be examin immedi via trap or at a conveni time via status flag trap can be use to stop a program but unrecover situat are extrem rare simpli stop a program is not an option for embed system or network agent more often trap log diagnost inform or substitut valid result
simon tatham state that there is a basic problem with anderson idea and thus with the idea of build a transreal supercomput it a categori error the anderson transrat and transreal are theoret algebra structur capabl of repres arbitrarili big and arbitrarili precis number so the question of their errorpropag semant is total meaningless you dont use them for downanddirti errorpron real comput you use them for prove theorem if you want to use this sort of thing in a comput you have to think up some concret represent of anderson tran in bit and byte which will if onli by the limit of avail memori be unabl to encompass the entir rang of the structur and the point at which you make this transit from theoret abstract algebra to concret bit and byte is precis where you should also be put in error handl becaus it where error start to becom possibl we defin our theoret algebra structur to obey lot of axiom like the field axiom and total order which make it possibl to reason about them effici in the prove of theorem we defin our practic number represent in a comput to make it easi to detect error the anderson transfoo are a consequ of fundament confus the one with the other and that by itself ought to be suffici reason to hurl them asid with great forc
geomer a startup compani special in simul softwar for physic and light and fund by angl plc had been ask to look into anderson work by an unnam client rich wareham a senior research and develop engin at geomer and a meng from the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY cambridg/ENTITY state that anderson system might be a more interest set of axiom for deal with arithmet except but it isnt the first attempt at just defin away the problem inde it doesnt fundament chang anyth the reason comput program crash when they divid by zero is not that the hardwar can produc no result mere that the programm has not dealt with nan as they propag through not deal with nulliti will similar lead to program crash
do the anderson transrat semant give ani advantag over the ieee one wareham ask answer well one assum they have been thought out to be use in themselv rather than to just propag error but im not sure that see a nulliti pop out of your code would lead you to do anyth other than what would happen if a nan or inf pop out name signal an error dr jame anderson offici web page at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY read/ENTITY access on ________ about us transreal comput ltd access on ________ compani/ENTITY hous/ENTITY databas entri for regist compani ________ access on ________
