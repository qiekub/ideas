thursday novemb __ ____
research have found a crucial genet differ between human and chimp that could help explain our languag and speech abil the differ lie in a gene call which encod for a protein of the same name this act as a transcript/ENTITY factor/ENTITY control the activ of other gene a render of the foxp_ protein
the human and chimp version of the protein differ in onli two of their ___ amino acid compon but when research at the univers/ENTITY of/ENTITY california/ENTITY los/ENTITY angel/ENTITY replac the human gene with the chimp version in neuron grown in the laboratori they found it affect the express of at least ___ other gene
the result are detail in a paper publish on thursday in the scientif journal author of the studi dr daniel geschwind of the david geffen school of medicin at ucla said the gene had a major role in differ between chimp and human we show that the human and chimp version of foxp_ not onli look differ but function differ too we believ foxp_ is not onli import for the higher order cognit aspect of languag but also for the motor aspect of speech and languag geneviev konopka univers of california los angel
some of the affect gene control the format of connect in the brain whilst other relat to facial movement sever have alreadi been found to be involv in languag disord mutat in foxp_ itself were also known to affect speech and languag the gene was first identifi in member of a famili suffer from languag problem who were found to share a genet mutat
franc varghakhadem at univers/ENTITY colleg/ENTITY london/ENTITY has studi patient with foxp_ mutat and agre with the new research as well as languag problem some of her subject have chang in the shape of their jaw mouth and tongu she think that chimp may also have these differ
we believ foxp_ is not onli import for the higher order cognit aspect of languag but also for the motor aspect of speech and languag said geneviev konopka one of the author of the paper at ucla
previous research indic that the chang in foxp_ occur around ______ year ago with the rise of modern human geschwind also suggest that sever of the relat gene may have evolv togeth preliminari studi have shown sign that they too emerg relat recent
scientist are now keen to further studi foxp_ and the gene that it affect geschwind believ this could eventu lead to breakthrough in treatment for disord such as autism and schizophrenia which affect languag skill
the studi was fund by the nation institut of mental health the ap giannini foundat and the nation allianc for research on schizophrenia and depress
