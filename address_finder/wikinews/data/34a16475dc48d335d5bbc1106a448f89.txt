start in realiti
mike halterman so youv been bill on the show as a paparazzi for tmzcom tell us exact what you do at your job what was your most excit workrel celebr sight
parker somervill it pretti excit and also at time it can be pretti bore i simpli wait outsid of major hollywood hot spot and get sound byte and reaction from celebr and public figur sometim it can be awkward but for the most part it pretti entertain my most funnyexcit workrel celebr encount was with wesley snipe he had us run up and down the street for like ___ minut and he was in a full suit how random it was exhaust but funni as hell
mh how much exposur did you have to big brother befor you were select to go on the show
ps i was never realli an avid watcher of big brother befor i was select to becom one of the houseguest i knew about the show but just didnt make time to watch it i can count on one hand how mani time i actual watch the show and that was just becaus noth els was on tv at the moment befor i went in the hous i did watch season _ and _ just to kind of familiar myself with the game i must say it pretti interest and i may watch futur season
mh who influenc you to audit
ps nobodi realli influenc me to audit i just saw a random ad on craigslist and was like whi the hell not meet a few peopleposs win some cashummmokay
mh in a previous interview i conduct with canada next top model winner andrea muizelaar she said that she believ realiti show cast peopl who are perhap unstabl to make for better televis do you feel that true
ps i dont believ the name of the game is to find the biggest whackjob and stick a mic and camera on them for good tv i think the produc of these show care look for the best mix of peopl to creat a stori around them they look for whos go to get along with who whos go to feud whos go to be the peac keeper hookup and so on
dont get me wrong everyon love to watch drama as long as it not them so of cours they are go to look for peopl with person issu but i dont think that all they cast for if you think about it the peopl with person issu could grow from their experi and becom better peopl after see how they were portray who know
the detour
mh you were realli not that thrill when jen the soulmat the show pick for you was in a previous outsid relationship with fellow houseguest ryan what were you think when jen reveal the news to you
ps when i first found out about the secret i was pretti piss at jen for not be honest with me from the start howev i thought it was a pretti good idea to have that secret allianc with them becaus jen and ryan definit didnt look like they were date so nobodi would have suspect it
mh also allison ryan partner was shown on the televis broadcast as be probabl more angri than you were who do you think was more angri about the develop you or allison
ps i think allison was more angri with the secret than i was just becaus she was forc to be in an allianc with jen and they didnt like each other
mh you were involv in some of the most dramat moment weve seen this season includ but not limit to you wake up the entir hous to find the person who had talk behind your back do you think be that direct was a good strategi for your game play also viewer of the show gather that you were unhappi with the way jen play the game but do you believ some of your action cost you the game as well
ps i didnt realli have a strategi when i went into the hous i was definit myself for the durat of my stay i was veri relax with everyon crack joke and enjoy everyon compani the great thing about me is that i can be your best friend and your worst enemi im cool but the moment you cross me ill do a ___ on you i guess that the ari in me when i woke up everyon in the hous i want to let everyon know dont take my kind for weak when i heard that whole snake comment it realli piss me off becaus i did absolut noth to make someon judg me so quick so i guess my direct approach to certain situat didnt help our current situat but i know for a fact i wouldnt have been as piss off as i was if i had control of my own fate in the hous yes i wasnt right for have a crappi attitud but i dont believ i made a major contribut to our demis
mh how do you feel about jen tell other houseguest that her reallif boyfriend ryan was racist to ensur that she stay in the game did you think that behavior cross a line
ps laugh i was like damn could you drive the stake in ani harder i felt like we had sheila vote and when jen told her that it onli hurt us i realli didnt think it was ani of the houseguest or america busi to know what ryan racial issu were i felt like she was not be fair to him becaus like it or not he was there to play the game just like she was and even if he was racist who care
mh you had said after leav the hous that you felt matt didnt keep his word to you as far as veto your nomin now that youv watch past footag do you still believ matt wrong you
ps i never said that matt didnt keep his word i knew he wasnt go to use the veto becaus he didnt want to becom an earli target well at least that what he told me beforehand
in my speech which they edit out i ask him not to use it becaus the reason whi we were nomin was becaus of trust issu when i got out of sequest i was talk with a few friend and i was tell them about how matt was cool as hell and they said obvious you havent seen the show
what make me salti at matt is the fact that he wasnt straightforward with me becaus i saw what he said in the dr about the situat also i jump on the live feed one day onli to see him talk crap about me with smellsia chelsia i call her smellsia becaus allison say her woman part down there arent too fresh i never onc said anyth bad about matt insid the hous and to see him just diss me like that realli didnt sit well with me i definit had his back and for him to talk crap on me especi when im not there to defend myself show what kind of person he realli is
mh what did you realli want to say to jen after you both got evict so earli in the game you were veri quiet when juli chen interview both of you
ps laugh you know damn well what i want to say to jen you saw my face that was worth more than word
come full circl back to realiti
mh this season big brother made the press rather negat compar to past season specif with incid like houseguest adam be fire from his job for a comment about retard amanda be taunt that she should hang herself with a noos just like her father and jame perform in multipl gay pornographi video what are your thought about all of these these event when do you think the other houseguest will find out about jame past in pornographi if they find out at all how do you think chelsia will react
ps i think it crazi it so funni that adam has no idea what impact his word had to america the other houseguest will find out at the wrap parti im sure of it i think smellsia wont care about jame past be the lowclass trash princess that she is shell definit not use protect after find out the great news good luck with that i wouldnt expect less from her
mh you were kept in sequest for a few week and onli recent allow to return to your normal life how doe it feel be recogn as that guy from the big brother show
ps i know for a fact that some peopl are go to come off this show think they are the next best thing sinc ice cream i still think im a nobodi yeah the opportun was great and the notorieti is cool but im still just same ol parker
it realli funni that peopl come up to me and want to take their pictur with me a few time when i was film a star all of a sudden i hear in the background oh my god it parker im realli flatter by all the attent and support im get from the fan i even sign a coupl of autograph now that was weird those autograph are probabl in the trash by now anyway laugh i think im gonna keep my night job
mh what option do you feel are open to you now that your stint on realiti tv is over are you go to continu your job at tmz or do you hope to break into act like previous houseguest have
ps im back to tmz and back to normal life i didnt come into this experi look for fame i realli dont want to be a big time actor it not realli my thing howev i wouldnt mind do some commerci or even a host gig just for the extra cash it would be pretti sweet to have the verizon guy job im open for whatev come my way
mh you were in the big brother hous for all of __ day with that tv experi behind you would you ever consid do anoth realiti tv show again
ps i would definit do big brother again im not too sure about other realiti tv show becaus i know i couldnt be myself on those show the greatest thing about big brother is that you dont have the camera crew and produc in your face to influenc your behavior
mh who would you hang out with after the show end and who would you rather not see again
ps i am more than like go to keep in contact with the first four who were evict with me and natali everyon els i could care less about for obvious reason but who know im a forgiv person so well have to see but for some of them i realli doubt it
mh there are eight contest left from the origin sixteen who are you root for to win and whi
ps natali i think shes an awesom person shes the onli real person left everyon els is pretti much synthet i think shell do great thing with the money
mh and final do you believ the big brother twist this season both the soulmat pair and jen and ryan outsid relationship rob you of win the game
ps allison ryan jen and myself had the best and worst situat in the entir hous i felt like my chanc werent all that great becaus i wasnt in control of my own situat if we were singl i know i would have last longer but there no use cri over spill milk right that big brother for ya
