whi have you chosen to involv yourself in the polit process whi did you choos to run in this constitu

what prior polit experi do you have what skill and insight can you bring to offic from other nonpolit posit you may have held

which of your competitor do you expect to pose the biggest challeng to your candidaci whi what make you the most desir of all candid run in the ride
anyon who believ that govern is the solut to the major of our problem health care educ and environ or believ taxat is good our parti is quit differ in that we believ the govern is the problem in the grand scheme of thing we would take power so we could great reduc our own power govern should be kept to an absolut minimum and not rule like a taxhungri leviathan
what do you feel are the three most import issu to voter in your ride are these the same top three issu that are most import to you what would you do to address these issu
the detroitwindsor border cross
wind turbin as a viabl sourc of renew energi
to address these issu i would do veri littl becaus we libertarian believ that the govern prevent ani real resolut these matter should be resolv civilli and judici in privat court without the govern unilater impos their will or without politician be financi bribe into favour one side
what should be the first order of busi in the __th legisl assembl
hypothet if libertarian ever gain power we would dissolv the govern to an absolut minimum and immedi seek measur to abolish taxat or curtail it as much as possibl
are the properti tax in your ride at a fair level for the amount of servic receiv in the municip
no libertarian believ properti owner should have exclus right over their land they bought their land and should own and control it themselv without be subject to govern scrutini if all other form of taxat were abolish we would convert properti tax to fee for municip servic and introduc as much free market choic as possibl properti owner should be the true assessor of their land valu not the govern
how can the provinc lead the way in stimul job creation
by introduc a free market which attract busi both small and larg and doesnt deter them due to exorbit taxat and govern intervent
what are your view on the mix member proport represent mmp referendum
it could potenti lead to a coalit govern wherebi a parti with the most seat form an allianc with the parti with the least seat need to form a major subsequ the smaller parti can hold the legislatur at ransom and threaten a new elect if they dont get their way elect cost taxpay which is anoth problem with our system whi should we have to pay for such shenanigan the mmp is good for name recognit and exposur but can lead to chao
what role if ani doe new media play in your campaign and the campaign of your parti websit blog facebook youtub video etc do you view it as benefici or a challeng
the medium is the messag as our good friend marshal mcluhan onc said it probabl hasnt play as larg a role as it should but fortun there are a number of websit which list all of the candid which is benefici for exposur ive also join the libertarian of essex counti facebook group to get my name as well as the parti out there the ontario libertarian parti as well as the libertarian parti of canada websit are great for inform on our platform as well as candid
of the decis made by ontario __th legisl assembl which was the most benefici to your this elector district to the provinc as a whole which was least benefici or even harm to your this ride to the provinc as a whole
general most decis are harm to all ontarian as the govern take away our freedom of choic and make decis they think well like or hope we accept base on their inabl to manag money and function cohes
