the chines invas and occup

ds how has the chines govern western/ENTITY china/ENTITY develop/ENTITY program affect ordinari tw of cours develop per se is to be welcom one of the reason whi his holi has repeat state for want to be part of china is the econom benefit tibet is underdevelop materi and econom it is backward in a develop sens tibetan peopl they need econom develop and assist if it is meant for the tibetan peopl it is to be welcom
but unfortun the develop plan they have and the impactw suspect and we now seeit first doesnt take into account the fragil environ second it is not benefit the local tibetan it is provid facil for the resettl of han/ENTITY chines/ENTITY in tibet at everi point of develop and ani casual visitor such as a tourist can see it all the develop is in chines/ENTITY town/ENTITY and/ENTITY citi/ENTITY the local peopl have becom more and more margin there are minor side benefit of cours but if it continu tibetan will becom a complet insignific minor increas margin if tibetan in tibet were enjoy econom develop there would be no reason for them to be unhappi
ds the phrase use to describ this by the exil tibetan govern is chines apartheid
tw effect it is the segreg of peopl the econom benefit are not go to tibetan who are second class citizen in tibet
ds how are the local peopl handl this situat
tw resent but tibet should be open up and weve alway said you should be abl to ask these question of local tibetan and not to me it is better to be abl to ask peopl in tibet open
ds but that not possibl
tw no journalist are not allow to go whi if tibetan peopl are happi and free to express their view then there is no reason whi peopl should not be allow to meet outsid report journalist are not allow to go though about four month back in the intern news it was report that of the __ tibetan in the tibetan chines communist parti __ were dismiss
ds whi
tw for not be loyal to the parti they were tibetan who were member of the chines communist parti who are hold post in the administr
ds have ani spoken out as to whi they were dismiss
tw no
tibetan reaction to the dalai lama congression gold medal ds what happen when the dalai lama receiv the congression/ENTITY gold/ENTITY medal/ENTITY tw restrict were impos on peopl in spite of that peopl express their happi better dress were worn that day
ds was there a crackdown
tw yes whi should that be if peopl are happi we have alway said that if peopl are happi we have no reason to continu
ds what is the status of the monk who were arrest after the dalai lama receiv the congression gold medal
tw accord to the report i have seen a larg number of peopl have been detain
ds at the drepung/ENTITY monasteri/ENTITY tw yes one of the monasteri was complet surround by troop the movement of peopl was high restrict and parti membersretir peoplewer warn that they would lose their pension im sure mani of them who despit these strong warn express their happi may have suffer i have no recent report on that
ds how difficult is it to receiv inform from tibet
tw not veri difficult our job is to repres peopl in tibet so our main effort is to tri to understand the situat and their feel their view therefor it is veri import to us to keep in touch with them and receiv accur object inform from insid tibet
ds do you know the situat with ronggay adrak the tibetan nomad who was arrest
tw what he said is nothingit was the basic ask for the releas of prison that his holi should be allow to return to tibet becaus of some democrat chang there has been land pressur with tibetan nomad so he also appeal to them to not fight amongst themselv for land ownership which would never have happen in the past in this countri nobodi would even notic what he said
ds what will happen to him
tw he has alreadi been sentenc to prison i think it was __ year
ds is that standard
tw yes it almost a treason act to make that kind of a call unfortun it is a veri serious crime in tibet
the disappear of gedhun choekyi nyima the eleventh panchen lama
ds where is chadrel rinpoch the man who select gedhun/ENTITY choekyi/ENTITY nyima/ENTITY as the eleventh panchen/ENTITY lama/ENTITY tw i have no inform
ds doe anyon
tw there was a report but i have no confirm inform at one point i heard he was not in good health he was appoint by the chines govern to search for the new panchen lama and he was in touch with us with the knowledg of the chines govern
ds the chines govern knew he was in touch with the dalai lama over the select
tw yes some of his peopl went to when his holi deleg was in beij they met and even sent some offer to his holi to pray for the quick discoveri of the panchen lama his holi has alway made it veri clear to the chines govern that the search for the genuineth import thing is we have to follow all the procedur to make sure that the genuin reincarn is discov it was made veri clear to the chines govern that his holi and the tibetan leadership outsid was will to work with the chines govern in this search at that time i was his holi repres in so i had a number of meet with chines offici to convey these messag there were no behindthescen they cant keep their panchen lama in tibet they tri to bring him to his monasteri mani time but peopl would not see him how can you have a religi leader like that when a panchen lama goe to his monasteri thousand and thousand of peopl will come from all over tibet and outsid he is an import buddhist leader but when they brought their panchen lama they had to forc govern offici and the public to attend certain public function tashi wangdi
ds so at age six gedhun choekyi nyima just disappear
tw when the final decis came close there was a lack of willing on the part of the chines leadership to involv his holi unfortun we then end up have two peopl now we dont know becaus sinc the age of six he has disappear it is total ridicul on the part of the chines offici who say he is kept in hide at the request of his parent for his secur that make no sens
ds and nobodi know where he is
tw no nobodi
ds what do you think will happen to him
tw i have no idea
ds do you think he is awar of his status
tw im sure he is matur now
ds but at six year of age it is probabl he was not abl to complet comprehend the fight between the two govern over who he was and what role he is to play if they were to take him at the age of six and place him somewher in reeduc him and deni him his heritag it is possibl he doe not even know who he is
tw i suppos it specul but there are apprehens on the part of the tibetan that this was the plan for take him away and keep him in isol to him at the same time by deduct one could say neither he nor his parent and other relat have given in to the chines govern becaus if they had they would have made some kind of public statement to say we do not think he is panchen lama we have been treat well and we are ordinari peopl noth has happen like that
ds there have been no rumor no word through the grapevin as to his status
tw no the logic deduct would be there is no cooper from the panchen lama side to follow the offici line
ds that pretti amaz when you consid it
tw it is amaz it also veri silli unnecessari it a religi matter is pure religi and it is a veri uniqu tradit in tibet if that is allow to be followedthrough it is the best way of win the heart and mind of peopl it the best diplomaci and a wise way of deal with thing now they have screw it up unnecessari
ds what do you think is the think on the part of the chines govern that this six year old boy would be a threat to their power
tw they sens their lack of legitimaci it weak it fear of illegitimaci they think everyth is go to blow up in their face in the long run it counterproduct
ds it would seem that by the chines govern instal their own person they have creat their own symbol of illegitimaci as oppos to allow religi practic to happen whilst keep their government author intact they have creat a symbol in the form of gyancain/ENTITY norbu/ENTITY of their illegitimaci and meddl in the cultur affair
tw that right
gyancain norbu the boy select by the chines govern
ds do you think gyancain/ENTITY norbu/ENTITY the boy the chines govern select as the eleventh panchen lama is a victim as well
tw as a good tibetan when he come to his age of make his own decis which he is about that age__ or __he will make the right decis
ds what would be the right decis
tw i think if he want to pursu religi leadership in tibetan custom we have more than one reincarn if he prove himself to be a good practition and religi leader peopl will treat him as a reincarn it a religi matter is pure religi and it is a veri uniqu tradit in tibet if that is allow to be followedthrough it is the best way of win the heart and mind of peopl it the best diplomaci and a wise way of deal with thing now they have screw it up wangdi on the chines govern select of the __th panchen/ENTITY lama/ENTITY ds but if he insist on his status as the panchen lama
tw if through his own contact and learn he prove himself to be worthi of be a reincarnationa i said there is more than one reincarn in our traditionthen peopl will treat him as a reincarn it not a polit institut panchen lama is a religi institut so you can have two reincarn i dont see it as a clash of interest
ds but he has no legitimaci now as the panchen lama where as the one the dalai lama select doe have that legitimaci is that correct
tw yes that right
ds gyancain norbu has not made ani statement
tw no late he has not been seen in public peopl are start to ask question and there have been specul report that he has escap or ran away there was specul but i cant comment on this the fact is that late has not been seen in public about a year or so ago he was promin shown in public as a propaganda for some reason of late he has not been physic seen or made ani statement attribut to him it rais question but i cant comment on specul
ds what do the tibetan peopl think about him
tw peopl will respond to him when he come out on his own i dont think peopl have ani bad feel against him person it not his fault
ds but they are against what he repres
tw yes at the moment it is not against him but against the chines author not against him as a person hes not assert himself
ds hes not tow the parti line but just keep quiet
tw yes that understand
ds so in a sens he is a victim himself
tw i suppos one could say that yes
the select of the next dalai lama
ds in septemb the chines govern has said they must approv all high monk
tw yes the state council has promulg some order it a religi matter and it ridicul for ani govern to interfer in religi affair no democrat govern would interfer not here in the unit state not in india china govern/ENTITY believ/ENTITY in/ENTITY atheism/ENTITY and doesnt believ in a religi tradit which is the communist govern in china it believ in religion as an a destruct element to interfer in that is irrelev ridicul and meaningless it is interfer in the affair of follow of tradit
ds how will it affect the choos of the next dalai lama
tw it will have no effect you cant impos a you cant impos an saint ani religionyou cant polit impos these thing on peopl it has to be a decis of the follow of that tradit the chines can use their polit power forc again it meaningless like their panchen lama and they cant keep their panchen lama in tibet they tri to bring him to his/ENTITY monasteri/ENTITY mani time but peopl would not see him how can you have a religi leader like that when a panchen lama goe to his monasteri thousand and thousand of peopl will come from all over tibet and outsid he is an import buddhist leader but when they brought their panchen lama they had to forc govern offici and the public to attend certain public function
ds how do they forc the public
tw they said if you dont come you will be punish and each famili has to send one person and so forth
ds how do they keep track of that
tw it a totalitarian/ENTITY system/ENTITY look at the former soviet/ENTITY union/ENTITY and china itself they keep track the civil system is built like that it run on the basi of fear they have develop an effect system of control and monitor
ds did the dalai lama support india/ENTITY nuclear/ENTITY test/ENTITY tw his holi has alway spoken against violenc arm sale he has sign with the other nobel laureat against arm sale and nuclear disarma when india explod a bomb he said india is a big countri and has it foreign concern so it would be unfair with it secur concern to deni of that abil to defend itself he also said that in the long run all the nuclear countri should work toward total disarma
the view of the dalai lama
ds what is his holi view on tw he has said mani time that as a buddhist take a life is wrong but on abort it depend on so mani other factor and stage of the develop of the and the circumst it a question for the mother and the child and he did say if there are development issu
ds he believ that it should be a person decis and not a government decis
tw yes
ds but that it frown upon as a buddhist principl
tw yes but he has certain spoken veri often on popul control but that is more on the prevent side
ds what are his holi view on homosexu
tw he said accord to buddhist practic it is wrong in societi it is all right i think of it like this i am buddhist you are christian let say for me i have to follow the precept and principl as a buddhist for me it would be wrong to do that but it would be wrong for me to say it is wrong for you becaus in multicultur multireligi societi you cant do that
ds so if somebodi is gay/ENTITY they/ENTITY could/ENTITY not/ENTITY be/ENTITY a/ENTITY proper/ENTITY buddhist/ENTITY tw im sure under certain precept of buddhist tradit a person would not be consid as follow all the precept of buddhist principl peopl dont follow all the principl veri few peopl can claim they follow all the principl for instanc tell a lie in ani religion if you ask if tell a lie is a sinsay christianthey will say yes but you find veri few peopl who dont at some point tell a lie homosexu is one act but you cant say they are not a buddhist or someon who tell a lie is not a buddhist or someon who kill an insect is not a buddhist becaus there a strong injunct against that
ds have you ever kill an insect
tw im sure yeah
ds is the dalai lama plan on visit latin america ani time soon
tw there likelihood that it will be next year we are look at it we have so mani invit from countri and everi few year we look to see what we can fit in
ds it like next year
tw we are think of it yes
ds do you know whi the dalai lama has not explicit said he is a reincarn of the dalai lama
tw in the broader sens it is a manifest so you can manifest in differ way he is talk in that sens it a broad principl argument
ds it that he believ he is a reincarn but whether he is the whole and sum of the __th/ENTITY dalai/ENTITY lama/ENTITY is anoth question
tw yes yes someth to that effect
ds do you have thought to share on the situat in tw his holi issu a statement soon after the recent crackdown in which he express his deep concern and sad over the violat and he express solidar with the buddhist monk and peopl ask for democraci he appeal to the general to refrain from use violencethey are buddhistsand as buddhist they should follow the teach of buddha and enter into meaning dialog
ds have you ani inform on their current status
tw no we follow whatev come into the media veri close it a buddhist countri and histor tibet and burma have good relat
ds it such a difficult region with mani complex disput
tw there are ethnic differ differ religion but through democrat process thing can be resolv let look at india and india is a huge countri so mani ethnic religiousthey have the second largest muslim popul after indonesiabut through a democrat process and the feder structur that came into be the last six year that through democrat process unfortun on the pakistan side with the same peopl same cultur the polit system is not fulli develop and you see more ethnic problem with burma if you see more democrat process im sure these problem will be work out
ds all over so mani peopl have longlast conflict and memori never seem to die
tw i think it a problem that is remnant of the british rule and all these new state came into exist when british rule was withdrawn but where democrat process came into place thing are better in place where interest group came into rule they divid but democraci reduc special interest
arunach pradesh an histor tibetan area of india claim by china
ds what is your view on arunach/ENTITY pradesh/ENTITY is the governmentinexil relat silenc over the issu due more to a recognit of india as a friend govern or doe the governmentinexil view the area as less tibetan than the area control by china
tw we are bound by the ____ simla/ENTITY convent/ENTITY under which the mcmahon/ENTITY line/ENTITY was form between india and tibet it has been accept both by british india and the tibetan govern so we are treati bound at that time the tibetan govern enter into and sign that agreement we cant chang the mcmahon line is the intern boundari and whatev fall on either side of that line is the territori of either india or as of now the peopl republ of china tibet

ds was lozang gyatso the director of institut of buddhist dialect murder by shugden worship
tw yes that a fact there some misunderstand that group take their own action is the polici of the tibetan govern but it not institut take advic and it is within their right to say they do not want shugden worship but now if a group of peopl say they want to set up their own institut becaus they are differ practition which is within their right
