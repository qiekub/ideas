tuesday januari __ ____
januari second interview/ENTITY of/ENTITY the/ENTITY month/ENTITY was with danni/ENTITY obrien/ENTITY of the electron/ENTITY frontier/ENTITY foundat/ENTITY eff on __ januari in the eff is come off a seri of highprofil success in their campaign to educ the public press and polici maker regard onlin right in a digit world and defend those right in the legislatur and the courtroom their settlement with the amaz confus mgm/ENTITY v/ENTITY grokster/ENTITY decis by the suprem/ENTITY court/ENTITY of/ENTITY the/ENTITY unit/ENTITY state/ENTITY and the disturb case surround diebold have earn the advocaci organ consider attent
when ask if the eff would be interest in a live interview in irc by the answer was a near immedi yes but just a littl after ricardo lobo with two such interest interview candid agre so quick it was hard to say no to either so schedul were juggl to have both by chanc the time work out to have the eff interview the day befor the us senat schedul hear concern the broadcast/ENTITY flag/ENTITY rule of the a form of digit right manag which the record and movi industri have been lobbi hard for and the eff has been lobbi hard to prevent
interview question wikinew id like to jump into some direct question which were suggest by peopl on the research page these first one relat to the us govern and onlin privaci
sinc ___ the us administr has been progress violat privaci standard in onlin communic includ circumv it own surveil law and developingand possibl implementingth total/ENTITY inform/ENTITY awar/ENTITY project what is eff posit regard govern monitor of privat communic such email instant messag and voic over ip
danni obrien sinc the veri begin the eff has work hard to keep the tradit law regard wiretap and monitor away from the internet not just becaus we believ in strong _th amend right but becaus technolog a wiretap on an individu line is mile away from what is need to do the equival on the internet that whi for instanc we fought against be extend to the net and whi were fight the fccs extens of it now
a lot of simpl approach to surveil that the govt would like to take are far from reason to use the languag of the _th amend
i should say that im use american exampl here but were obvious concern more general
wikinew a relat question will eff be involv in case even as amicus such as the case file by detroit and the center/ENTITY for/ENTITY constitut/ENTITY right/ENTITY new york which alleg the nation/ENTITY secur/ENTITY agenc/ENTITY violat us law prohibit wiretap without a warrant
danni obrien were current look into everi possibl avenu one of the difficulti is tri to ascertain exact what the govern program involv the eff has a batteri of lawyer with differ area of interest
wikinew is this in the same vein as the recent request for googl to poni up it search databas
danni obrien no that a great question the two issu are veri differ but i think speak to the problem that the internet is now be seen as a resourc for govern surveil and research which we think that all net compani have to becom awar of there a real danger in simpli log everyth you end up risk be a tool for the invas of your own custom privaci
wikinew googl alon of the largest search engin refus the justic depart demand to turn over user data the eff is on record as critic googl privaci polici how doe the eff feel about that privaci polici now what doe eff feel about the other search engin behaviourdid they compli with their own privaci polici doe this incid reflect the strength or weak of corpor privaci polici onlin
danni obrien privaci polici larg extend at the moment to mere the descript of what inform is store weve long warn against compani collect larg amount of data about their custom and do noth to anonymis or aggreg it we think that compani are store up troubl for themselv this way
wikinew doe the eff have ani materi or program that seek to educ employ and compani on the advantag of privaci
danni obrien we do hold on i should be hand out more url is our guid to onlin servic provid for the best practic in log data im also speak at the mysql confer later this year on what not to includ in your schema it an interest area becaus it one where coder have a degre of power over what can be done
person id like to see a great deal more knowledg about how to aggreg and anonymis data be spread among the communiti im constant recommend the book transluc databas which cover this veri nice also the oss sourc would do a great servic by set reason default for softwar log behaviour the troubl is and i think we all fall into this trap we assum the more log the better how mani of us are casual log this for instanc
wikinew id like to talk about the soni bmg case for a bit if that okay first congratul to eff in regard to some of the success in the soni bmg case there are some question clarif about the case howev the settlement appear to cover the xcp and suncomm softwar deliv on cds what about openmg xcp drm use by soni bmgs sonicstag softwar for soni connect
danni obrien okay this is where i have to say that im a bit limit in what i can say ah if onli out of blind ignor in this particular case
wikinew do you know if the openmg xcp softwar is mention at all in the agreement
danni obrien i dont know about openmg we join the case repres xcp and suncomm user so i dont think that was cover but watch me shine the giant neon ianal sign abov me if you like i can ask after the interview and we can add that to the result
wikinew id appreci that
can you disclos the term of the settlement regard futur use of softwar drm measur have they promis not to alter user machin in the futur
danni obrien again it alway danger to paraphras legal document ah we have an faq that cover this thank good wikinew this case also has some connect to copyright infring the xcp softwar includ code taken from the vlc media player softwar which is releas under the gpl is eff involv in ani case regard this
danni obrien no we didnt cover this we dont have stand to take on the copyright issu ie we would have to repres a copyright holder
wikinew would eff be involv in such a case if ask
danni obrien itd be an interest case but we tri to distribut these case to where the expertis lie dure the soni bmg case we spoke to group like the fsf and the softwar freedom law center general speak theyr the peopl who would be best place to investig case like this
it worth say that were realli pleas that there now a whole constel of great organis that we work with fsf the berkman center public knowledg in dc the list goe on
wikinew the soni bmg case is a content produc attempt to enforc drm on their client the us fcc is tri to do the same thing on the hardwar of us citizen with the broadcast flag i know the eff is involv in the lobbi on this but i have question which lead into this this is a hardwar issu doe it matter on the internet
danni obrien yes for a number of reason
the point about the broadcast and audio flag is that they set up a kind of ghetto for content the whole point of both is to prevent distribut onto the internet but in order to do that you need to creat a hardwar world which is fenc off from not just the net but from user modif and open sourc develop
this ghetto has to be creat in everi audiovisu devic by govern mandat so that affect the net a coupl of way first you essenti curtail the net use but second these flag are easili though illeg circumvent so they general prompt even more draconian law which are just as easili circumvent
one of our biggest problem with the flag is they cross/ENTITY a/ENTITY rubicon/ENTITY they creat a govern technolog mandat in user tech onc you start down that pathespeci when you discov your initi mandat doesnt actual workyou just ask for more and more control
wikinew isnt this alreadi the case consid the hdtv standard and other isnt standard an element of the fccs mandat
danni obrien standard for broadcast and recept but not standard for what you do after you receiv someth rememb the fccs primari job is to prevent interfer and to manag the common of the public airwav it a huge overreach for it to take over what you do with what come from over those airwav
wikinew becaus this is a rule not a law how doe the eff plan to approach it in the us congress
danni obrien well the initi regul was thrown out by the court who agre with us that this was agenc overreach so what weve seen now is group like the mpaa and riaa attempt to extend the fccs power by law
for all of last year they attempt to do that by well for want of a better word sneakili attach the necessari languag to other bill as you say it can potenti be a veri small amend so i suppos they felt that they could do this everyon fought an incred effect campaign to prevent this and a lot of that had to do with the netw hear from the hill of a lobbyist attempt to includ the regul and wed be abl to organis call and letter from constitu veri quick
most politician strang enough dont like it when someth is sneak past them and we manag to alert a lot of them to argument they werent hear from broadcast lobbyist
now were see a second stage which is hollywood come out into the open and present the flag open that stage begin tomorrow with senat hear on the topic
wikinew the senat will begin hear on this rule tomorrow what doe eff expect to happen dure this legisl process how might this affect onlin communiti to get specif and person what doe it mean to wikinew reader and contributor
danni obrien if the law pass itll have dramat effect particular to wikinew futur actual i think we can all forese a time when wikinew would take fair use sampl of the news and public affair both audio and visual with a broadcast or audio flag in place that usag while legal would effect disappear or at least be much much harder
more general youll see advanc in tech frozen in a lot of area the pull away of open sourc develop in anyth that was connect to hd tv or digit radio the biggest problem here is that technolog like the flag give the entertain industri a stick to hit the technolog industri befor the broadcast flag was even introduc hollywood was line up object to technolog like wikinew i understand that would be the case in the usa but could you explain how this might affect peopl in the eu or anywher outsid the usa
danni obrien sure one of the area that we spend a lot of time with these daysw have two staff work full time on intern issuesi what call polici launder so for instanc the worst provis of the dmca have general been introduc into law in countri like australia by their inclus in bilater free trade agreement alreadi hollywood repres have been work in europ and elsewher to introduc the equival of the broadcast flag there the rule is that if you can introduc it in one countri that make it a lot easier to export it elsewher
danni obrien copyright extens is a great exampl of this in that the last us copyright extens was introduc to track europ and now europ is be encourag to match it copyright with the us were alreadi see that with copi control mandat like the flag
wikinew the broadcast flag is a form of digit right manag in this case implement by the us fcc there are other drm issu to talk about in the french parliament the dadvsi law which relat to the implement of the ____ european direct on copyright in franc is under activ consider has the eff had the opportun to consid this law and what is the opinion if so
danni obrien actual i was just talk to about this befor the interview start were keep as close an eye on this as we can it a good exampl of the ratchet problem as it an implement of the eucd
wikinew canada and belgium appli heavi tax on copi medium and the revenu from these tax are use to support creativ artist and develop as an altern to support drm what doe eff feel about such a method to control fair usefair deal
danni obrien actual we prefer a system of voluntari licens scheme over either of these approach wikinew there are effort under way to develop an open standard drm such as a project by sun microsystem which is relat fair to user would eff support an open standardopen sourc drm or is the entir concept of drm consid unaccept in ani form
danni obrien our take on sun drm essenti our disagr isnt with drm per se it drm back up by the dmcas anticircumvent law if user had the right to circumv drm to exercis their fair use right we think the market would quick sort out what control on media use were accept and what were not
wikinew a followon question from the french one doe eff plan to set up some chapter in europ
danni obrien franc like mani countri has a great core of activist and advoc alreadi wed be delight to help them in ani way we can
wikinew a followon question regard the soni bmg case doe eff have a respons to the regist articl danni obrien sigh i wonder if this would turn up it a realli odd articl given that it includ a bunch of case that arent our one that we didnt lose and other odditi i think wed rather let the fact speak for themselv here a list of our victori there a longer list at the wikipedia/ENTITY entri/ENTITY wikinew are there ani question i should have ask you which i did not
danni obrien hahah no but im happi to take addit question im actual tri to think of some of the harder question
wikinew well i think ill ask mrm to unmoder now and let everyon mob you
mrmiscellani alright here we go
mrmiscellani made this room no longer moder for normal user
danni obrien i guess the question we often get ask is whi arent you do someth about x where x is a matter that realli is importantth simpl answer to that is that we have limit resourc which is whi im realli happi to see lot of other organis spring up
question doe eff support tor financi or otherwis anymor
danni obrien we host tor websit but direct fund was for last year actual the tor question realli are so frequentlyl ask that theyr best answer on tor faq includ the legal faq we wrote for them question enwikipedia prevent tor endpoint from edit on the site doe eff consid such classblock an accept respons to behavior or is it general inappropri
danni obrien were disappoint we hope there a way of provid a technic solut that would work to support tor aim and would be practic for wikipedia if we can work as an intermediari in that discuss wed be happi to
question european organis which have similar goal like the eff were not success in prevent telecommun data retent what conclus doe the eff draw for their own campaign
danni obrien i have a long answer to that with my eff hat off
okay so the reason ill take my eff hat off to answer your question is becaus im also involv in which is one of those organis in europ the conclus is that advocaci need resourc one of the strength of eff and other us advocaci group is they are perman with a paid staff i think that now there are site like around and fact like the wikipedia fund drive show that were get to the point where we can turn volunt organis into group that have that flexibl plus financi resourc which mean you get to the situat where the group of volunt who form org can now work on project like submit to uk parliamentari inquiri there are fantast group in europ like and i think the time is now right for those group to be given more resourc by everyon and i speak as someon who tradit come out in hive when money is mention it a big leap but i think it one we all have to work at get right give to them at exact the same time as you join the eff danni obrien put eff hat back on
question danni obrien onc success lobbi a cockney london pub to join richard m stallman in a spontan demonstr of bulgarian folk danc can you give detail
danni obrien rms is a great fan of folkdanc and was teach me and some friend the danc move to the free softwar song in a pub in shoreditch mayb it was the alcohol all the alleg viral natur of the gpl but by the end we had most of the pub do them he love it although recent i believ hes hurt his leg and cant do it so much ani more
question wikipedia was earlier attack by a group which has launch a websit claim that wikipedia should be upheld by law to have ___ factual in their websit relat to an earlier case where a bogus biographi was post to wikipedia what is the eff stanc on the issu
danni obrien im not sure of the site that you refer to but obvious wed support wikipedia on this matter we dont see ani problem with wikipedia process
question there is an articl on dewikipedia german about the hacker tron his full offlin name is includ in the articl a german court has issu an injunct prevent the wikipediad websit the websit of the german wikimedia foundat from link to the dewikipedia site which is outsid the jurisdict of that court what doe eff think about such extran effect of local law doe a person name especi a figur as well known as tron deserv special privaci the order was obtain base on a propos by the deceas hacker famili and it should be point out that the hacker real name was known for a long time
danni obrien it a good question honest it depend on the law and the practic of the law i cant speak to the case particular as the last i heard the fact werent clear in this case it not the territori of the law that of concern it whether anyon should be forbidden from link to a resourc
