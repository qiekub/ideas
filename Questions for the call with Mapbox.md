# Questions for the call with Mapbox


## Spam
How do I prevent spam?
Cookies, fingerprinting, ...? (privacy concerns)


## Datasets
Has Mapbox experience with importing and managing datasets?

manually/automatically importing data from other maps
AND/VS
chaching data from wikipedia/wikidata


## Rendering of the maptiles
Is it possible to have raster-tiles dynamically? So that the country-names fit the users-language and dark-or-light-mode?

I want the names of the country be in the users language and the maps theme the users prefered one.

To many map combinations.

**Can this be done dynamically?**

The map is currently in dark and light mode and with the local names. (I can't read most place-names in hindu or chiniese.)


## Questions / Information
What's information should be displayed?




# Follow up mail to Nicki


Hi Nicki,

THANKS for the call!

I just wanted to follow up with the most important open question, so they wont be forgotten:

Do you have any suggestions on how to prevent spam entries or over editing?
Particular with the topic of privacy in mind.

Has Mapbox best practices for importing datasets?

I want the map-tiles to use the users browser language.
Would I need to create a different style for every language or is it possible to generate the different raster-tiles from one style? Like by sending a get-parameter in the style-url.

I look forward to your answers!

It was awesome talking to you and I'd love to here your feedback while the project progresses.

Best,
Thomas
