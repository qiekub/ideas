## Spam
How do I prevent spam?
Cookies, fingerprinting, ...? (privacy concerns)


## Datasets
Has Mapbox experience with importing and managing datasets?

manually/automatically importing data from other maps
AND/VS
chaching data from wikipedia/wikidata


## Rendering of the maptiles
Is it possible to have raster-tiles dynamically? So that the country-names fit the users-language and dark-or-light-mode?

I want the names of the country be in the users language and the maps theme the users prefered one.

To many map combinations.

**Can this be done dynamically?**

The map is currently in dark and light mode and with the local names. (I can't read most place-names in hindu or chiniese.)
