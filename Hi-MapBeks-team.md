Hi MapBeks team,

I'm exited about your mapping event!
Even though I'm from Germany. I would love to help the LGBTQ+ community all around the world.

I'm currently building a website to consolidate all resources needed to end discrimination against minorities.

As I myself am queer, the website starts with a global map of all LGBTQ+ save spaces. The project is in an early stage. (We currently don't even have a name for it.) But I would love to hear your thoughts about it.
Here's the link: https://map.qiekub.org/

I signed up for your event and help if I can. But keep in mind that I'm from Germany ðŸ˜‚

Best,
Thomas

Yes ðŸ˜Š I saw your map!

I love that you also provide infos about the "Anti-Discrimination Ordinances"-zones.
I think that's especially useful to tourists ðŸ˜ƒ

I noticed the link under "To nominate an LGBT safe space, click here" doesn't work. Is this intentional?

I love the amount of detail in Manila and that you provide infos about the zones.

As I'm not familiar with the LGBTQ-rights in the Philippines, I'm currious  

lgbt_status: ["nominated", "verbal confirmation", "news featured"]


I of course wondered
