# Roadmap

## Finish a first version of the map
The map should present queer-youth-centers and other queer places.

### TODO:
- Map tiles in specific languages
	❓Is it possible to have raster-tiles dynamically? So that TThe country-names fit the users-language and dark-or-light-mode?
- Edit / Questions
	- ❓How can people add sources/references to their answers? #design #ui_flow
	- ❓How do I prevent spam?
		A cookie / sessionID / userID / fingerprint / ...?
		Are the better ways? / More privacy-optimistic ways?
	- Add more Questions:
		- What type of place is this?
			I already have a list of amenities(/presets) used by the OpenStreetMap-Editor (iD).
		- For whom is this place primarily intended?
			Trans, Woman, Gay, Bears, ... Any way the queer-scene categorizes.
		- Where can somebody find out more about this place?
			A textfield to enter links to social media, a website, wikipedia, wikidata, ...
		- Is this places permanently closed?
		- On which date/year did this place open? #follow_up_question
		- On which date/year did this place close? #follow_up_question
	- A way to suggest new questions.
	- It currently isn't possible to choose a location on small devices. #mobile #ui
	- What about photos?
- Filter
	- For which category/tribe/gender/... the place is.
	- If the place is spam or not.
		This could be granular. So the term spam would be the probability of the place being spam.
	- If the place exists or not.
		This could be a date-range-chooser. The map should then just show places that exist(ed) in this date range.
