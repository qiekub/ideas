# Privacy Policy Structure
Ein paar Gedanken dazu, wie ich nicht in einer Ellen-langen Datenschutzbestimmung ende, die keiner durschlesen m√∂chte.


## What I want:
- Any human should be able to easily and quickly understand the whole PP!
- Parts of the PP should be easily referenced on the website, so nobody has to read the whole PP to use the website.


## How can I get it:
- Any part of the PP should have these comonents to make the part easier to understand.
	1. A heading in "one or two" words.
	2. A short summery for the every-day-human.
	3. The legal binding text.
	4. Controls to opt-in/opt-out if possible.
- Everything should be available in normal and simplified language.
- Everything should be translatted in as many languages as possible. But it must be clear that only one specifc language is the legal binging version. (Probably German to stay in german-law)
- Any part should be able to be included where it applies on the websites.
- Controls for cookies etc. should be available in the PP.
- All versions need to be available. And it must be clear when the version changed and why. (GIT could be enough.)
- The PP could be saved in a YAML-file. This would make it ease to be read by a human and a computer. But could also be visualize on a website in a nice design for the every-day-human.


## Technicals

We can use Github for the version history.
Example: https://github.com/Uberspace/lab/commits/master/source/guide_ghost.rst
To make this easy, every section should be a seperate file.
