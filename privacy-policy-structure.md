# Privacy Policy Structure

## What I want:
- Parts of the PP should be easely referenced in the the website.
- Any human should be able to to easely and quickly understand the whole PP!

## Ideas
- Any part of the PP could be shown in multiple steps.
	1. A heading in one or two words.
	2. A short description for the every-day-human.
	3. The legal binding text. (Probably German)
- Everything should be available in normal and simplified language.
- Everything should be translatted in as many languages as possible. But it must be clear that only one specifc language is the legal binging version. (Probably German to stay in german-law)
- Any part should be able to be included where it applies on the websites.
- All versions need to be available. And it must be clear when the version changed and why. (To use GIT could be enough.)
