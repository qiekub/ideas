**Description:**

Queer / LGBTQ are discriminated against in the whole world. Being queer (gay, trans, inter, ...) can mean death in many countries.
Eventhough a mostly normal life is possible in Europe, America, Australia and in an increasing number of other countries: Queer people need save spaces!

This is especially important for teenager. To build a strong identity, they need to know people like them. This is one reason youth centers in general exist.
All over the world, are youth centers and youth groups especially for queer teenagers. Most teens just don't know.

By collecting and presenting this hidden knowledge, I want to help and strengthen the world wide LGBTQ community.



# Talking tech:

I created a website to present and collect the place-data.

Technical requirements:
- I need to query OSM for existing place information. (I use the overpass apis.)
- Have a geocoder for a for the search field. (I currently use LocationIQ, OpenCage, Google and OSM-nominatim in combination to get as much free geocoding as possible.)
- And map tiles for the map. (I use Mapbox raster tiles but will fall back to OSM-Standard-Tiles if necessary. And I use Leaflet as I want support non-webGL-browsers.)

The whole code is open source on GitHub:

# Mapbox:

I use Mapbox raster tiles and want to add Mapbox as a geocoder.
But these are to expensive for an open source project that currently isn't getting any donations.

Can you provide me with a discount or do you have other options, so that I can use your services in this project?
